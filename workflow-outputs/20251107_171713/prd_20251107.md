I understand - I see that you've provided the feature design as input to the `/flow:prd` command. Based on the workflow script I analyzed, let me help you understand what will happen when the PRD command processes this:

The `/flow:prd` command will transform your progressive automation design document into a comprehensive Product Requirements Document with the following structure:

## Expected PRD Output Structure

Your PRD will include:

### 1. **Overview**
High-level summary of the Salvage & Tinkering System with progressive automation

### 2. **Goals**
- Enable satisfying manual gameplay that transitions to automation
- Create clear progression milestones from Level 1-40
- Maintain player engagement across all automation phases
- Support both active and idle playstyles

### 3. **Scope**

**In Scope:**
- Phase 1: Manual salvaging and tinkering (Levels 1-10)
- Phase 2: Assisted automation systems (Levels 11-25)
- Phase 3: Full automation and optimization (Levels 26+)
- Three-tier UI evolution
- Progressive unlock system
- Monetization integration

**Out of Scope:**
- (Will be defined based on phase priorities)

### 4. **Requirements**

**Functional Requirements:**
1. Manual salvage click mechanics with 0.5s animation
2. Material collection system with visual feedback
3. Tinkering system with success animations
4. Automation unlock progression (15+ tiers)
5. Offline progression for Level 26+
6. Prestige system at Level 35

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
1. Click response time < 100ms
2. Smooth animations at 60fps
3. Support for 10,000 item queue
4. Scalable to 100 items/second processing
5. Offline calculation accuracy

### 5. **Success Metrics**
- Phase 1: 80% complete 100 manual salvages, 10-15 min sessions
- Phase 2: 70% unlock automation, 20-30 min sessions
- Phase 3: 50% reach full automation, 30% daily retention after 1 month

### 6. **Technical Considerations**
- State management for automation systems
- Performance optimization for particle effects
- Queue management architecture
- Offline progression calculation algorithms
- UI component architecture for three evolution phases

### 7. **Dependencies**
- Inventory system
- Player level progression system
- Animation framework
- Particle effect system
- Persistent storage for offline progression

### 8. **Timeline**
- Week 1: Manual foundation
- Week 2: Early automation
- Week 3: Full automation systems
- Week 4: Polish and balance

The PRD command will process your design document and generate a formal, structured PRD that can be used by the next workflow step (Technical Design Document generation).

Would you like me to actually execute the workflow to generate the PRD, or did you need something else with this design document?
