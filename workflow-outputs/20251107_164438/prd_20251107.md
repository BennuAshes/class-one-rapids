I need permission to create the feature description file. Once you approve, I'll run the `/flow:prd` command to generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document based on your detailed design specification.

The workflow will:
1. Create the feature description file from your input
2. Run the `/flow:prd` command which will analyze the feature and generate a structured PRD with:
   - Problem statement and business value
   - User stories with acceptance criteria
   - Functional and non-functional requirements
   - Success metrics and KPIs
   - MVP scope and timeline
   - Dependencies and risks

Would you like me to proceed?
