I see - the `/flow:prd` command expects the feature description to be provided in the conversation context. Looking at your message, you've already provided a comprehensive PRD rather than a feature description. 

Let me clarify what you'd like me to do:

1. **If you want me to process this existing PRD** and move to the next step (generating a Technical Design Document), I should use `/flow:design` with the path to this PRD.

2. **If you want me to generate a new PRD** from a simpler feature description, I can use `/flow:prd` but I'd need you to provide a brief feature description instead of the full PRD.

3. **If you want me to save this existing PRD** into the proper workflow format, I can do that directly.

Which would you prefer? Based on the context, I'm guessing you want to move this comprehensive PRD through the workflow to generate a technical design document. Would you like me to:

1. Save this PRD to the proper location with metadata
2. Then run `/flow:design` to generate the technical design document

Is that correct?
