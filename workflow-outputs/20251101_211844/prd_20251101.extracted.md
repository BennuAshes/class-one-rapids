I notice that the feature description wasn't provided as part of the slash command arguments. Could you please provide the feature description? You can either:

1. Provide a file path to a feature description document
2. Describe the feature directly

For example:
- `/flow:prd /path/to/feature-description.md`
- `/flow:prd Add user authentication with OAuth2 support`

What feature would you like me to create a PRD for?
