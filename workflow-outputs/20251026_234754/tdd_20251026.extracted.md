I need to understand what PRD you'd like me to work with. You mentioned "PRD extraction failed" - could you please provide one of the following:

1. The path to the PRD file you want me to use
2. The content of the PRD directly
3. Point me to a specific PRD in your workflow-outputs directory (I can see several workflow output folders)

For example, I can see there's a PRD in `workflow-outputs/20251025_215307/prd_20251025.md`. Would you like me to use that one, or a different PRD?
