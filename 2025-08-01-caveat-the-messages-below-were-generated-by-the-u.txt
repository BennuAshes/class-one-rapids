✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to create a file called "research.md" 
  in the ".claude/commands" directory. This file should be
   a generic template for doing research on any topic, 
  based on their example prompt about researching AI 
  testing for React Native/Expo apps.

  Let me break down what they want:
  1. Create a file at .claude/commands/research.md
  2. Make it a generic template that can be used for any 
  research topic
  3. The template should involve deep thinking 
  (ULTRATHINK) and web research
  4. It should present a plan based on the findings
  5. The research should be saved to a markdown file

  Since this is a multi-step task, I should use the 
  TodoWrite tool to track my progress.

✻ Thinking…

  I've successfully created the research.md template file 
  in .claude/commands. The template provides a generic 
  structure that can be used for any research topic, with 
  clear variables that can be replaced, a structured 
  process, and expected output format. The user can now 
  use this template to conduct research on any topic by 
  filling in the appropriate variables.

● Created .claude/commands/research.md with a generic
  research command template that can be used for any
  topic.

> is this in the format of a claude code command? if not 
  can you do research how to do that and think deeply 
  about what needs to be modified in this file to align 
  with that

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking if the research.md file I created is 
  in the format of a Claude Code command. They want me to 
  research how Claude Code commands should be formatted 
  and then modify the file to align with that format.

  I need to:
  1. Research Claude Code command format
  2. Compare it with what I created
  3. Modify the file if needed

  Let me first research what Claude Code commands look 
  like by checking the documentation or existing examples.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research Claude Code command format                
     ☐ Compare current research.md with proper format
     ☐ Modify research.md to align with Claude Code
       command format

✻ Thinking…

  I need to research the Claude Code command format. Let 
  me check the Claude Code documentation to understand how
   commands should be structured.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research Claude Code command format                
     ☐ Compare current research.md with proper format

       command format

✻ Thinking…

  Let me research Claude Code command format by checking 
  the documentation. I'll use WebFetch to get information 
  about slash commands and command formats.

● Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sla
       sh-commands)
  ⎿  Received 2.1MB (200 OK)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand the proper format for Claude Code 
  commands! Let me check what other Claude Code 
  documentation might help, specifically about settings 
  and command structure.

● Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/set
       tings)
  ⎿  Received 2.1MB (200 OK)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a good understanding of Claude Code command 
  format. Let me compare this with what I created and then
   modify the file. The current file I created is more 
  like documentation about how to use a command template, 
  but it should actually BE the command itself.

  Key differences:
  1. My current file is documentation about a command 
  template, not an actual command
  2. It needs frontmatter with proper metadata
  3. It needs to use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input
  4. The content should be the actual prompt that will be 
  executed
  5. It should specify allowed-tools in frontmatter

  Let me update the todo and start comparing.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Research Claude Code command format                
     ☐ Compare current research.md with proper format
     ☐ Modify research.md to align with Claude Code

✻ Thinking…

  Let me read the current research.md file to see what 
  needs to be changed.

● Read(.claude/commands/research.md)
  ⎿  Read 61 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I can see the issue clearly. My current file is 
  documentation ABOUT a command template, but it should 
  actually BE the command itself. Based on the Claude Code
   documentation, I need to:

  1. Add proper frontmatter with metadata
  2. Replace the documentation with the actual command 
  prompt
  3. Use $ARGUMENTS to make it dynamic
  4. Specify allowed tools that the command will need

  The command should:
  - Use WebSearch for research
  - Use Write to create files
  - Potentially use Bash to create directories
  - Use Task for complex research operations

  Let me update the todo status and rewrite the file.

● Update Todos

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to rewrite the research.md file to be an 
  actual Claude Code command instead of documentation 
  about a command. It should have:

  1. Frontmatter with:
    - description: Brief description of what the command 
  does
    - argument-hint: To show users what arguments to 
  provide
    - allowed-tools: The tools the command needs
  2. The actual command prompt that will be executed, 
  using $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input

  Let me rewrite it now.

✻ Thinking…

  The user asked if the file was in the proper Claude Code
   command format, and I've now researched and corrected 
  it. The file is now properly formatted as a Claude Code 
  command with:

  1. Proper frontmatter with description, argument-hint, 
  and allowed-tools
  2. Uses $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input
  3. Contains the actual command prompt that will be 
  executed
  4. Specifies the tools it needs (WebSearch, Write, Bash,
   Task, TodoWrite)

  I should give a brief response explaining that I've 
  corrected the format.

● No, it wasn't in the proper Claude Code command format.
  I researched the correct format and updated it.

  Key changes made:
  - Added frontmatter with description, argument-hint, and
   allowed-tools
  - Replaced documentation with the actual executable
  command prompt
  - Used $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input handling
  - Specified required tools: WebSearch, Write, Bash,
  Task, TodoWrite

  The file is now a proper Claude Code command that can be
   invoked with /research <topic> <objective> [filename].

   item in the research folder before making an 
  assessment. Use keywords that maximize the effectiveness
   of the prompt. Follow claude code slash command best 
  practices. it should also use the software-architect

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to create a file at 
  .claude/commands/refinement.md that:

  1. Takes a high level list of user stories from a 
  product owner
  2. Refines them into a series of files at a provided 
  folder name
  3. Uses ULTRATHINK 
  4. Reads every item in the research folder before making
   an assessment
  5. Uses keywords that maximize the effectiveness of the 
  prompt
  6. Follows Claude Code slash command best practices
  7. Should use the software-architect agent

  Let me think about this structure:

  1. This should be a Claude Code command with proper 
  frontmatter
  2. It needs to use $ARGUMENTS for the user stories and 
  folder name
  3. It should use the Task tool to launch the 
  software-architect agent
  4. It needs to read all files in the research folder 
  first
  5. It should use effective prompt engineering keywords
  6. It should follow the format I learned about Claude 
  Code commands

  Key tools needed:
  - Task (to use software-architect agent)
  - Read (to read research files)
  - Glob (to find research files)
  - Write (to create refined files)
  - Bash (potentially for directory operations)
  - TodoWrite (for task management)

  The command should:
  1. First read all research files
  2. Use ULTRATHINK to analyze the user stories
  3. Launch the software-architect agent to do the 
  refinement
  4. Create the refined files in the specified folder

  Now I need to create the refinement.md file. Let me 
  think through the structure:

  1. Frontmatter with description, argument-hint, and 
  allowed-tools
  2. The main command that uses ULTRATHINK
  3. Instructions to read all research files first
  4. Use the software-architect agent via Task tool
  5. Create refined files in the specified folder

  Key elements to include:
  - Use $ARGUMENTS for user stories and folder name
  - Read all research files first for context
  - Use ULTRATHINK for deep analysis
  - Launch software-architect agent
  - Create systematic refinement process
  - Use effective prompt engineering keywords

  Let me structure this properly:

● Write(.claude/commands/refinement.md)

✻ Thinking…

  Good! I've created the refinement.md command file. Let 
  me mark the todo as completed.

  The file includes:
  1. Proper frontmatter with description, argument-hint, 
  and allowed-tools
  2. Uses $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input
  3. Systematic process with ULTRATHINK
  4. Reads all research files first for context
  5. Uses the software-architect agent via Task tool
  6. Comprehensive prompt engineering with effective 
  keywords
  7. Detailed methodology and deliverables specification
  8. Follows Claude Code slash command best practices

  The command structure follows a three-phase approach:
  - Phase 1: Read all research for context
  - Phase 2: ULTRATHINK analysis of user stories
  - Phase 3: Execute via software-architect agent with 
  detailed instructions

  This should provide a robust user story refinement 
  system.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Create refinement.md command file for user story 
       refinement

✻ Thinking…

  The user requested a refinement command file and I've 
  successfully created it. The file follows Claude Code 
  best practices and includes all the requirements they 
  specified:

  1. ✅ Takes high level user stories and folder name via 
  $ARGUMENTS
  2. ✅ Uses ULTRATHINK for deep analysis
  3. ✅ Reads every item in research folder first
  4. ✅ Uses software-architect agent via Task tool
  5. ✅ Uses effective prompt engineering keywords
  6. ✅ Follows Claude Code slash command best practices
  7. ✅ Proper frontmatter with description, 
  argument-hint, allowed-tools

  The command is now ready to be used with /refinement 
  <user-stories> <output-folder>.

● Created .claude/commands/refinement.md with a
  comprehensive user story refinement system.

  Key features:
  - 3-phase process: Research analysis → ULTRATHINK →
  Software architect execution
  - Comprehensive research integration: Reads all research
   files first for domain knowledge

> Is it worth noting, maybe in the last paragraph (or 
  wherever you think is best), that each file should 
  contain everything needed from the research to implement
   the story?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking if I should note that each file 
  should contain everything needed from the research to 
  implement the story. This is a good point - it would 
  ensure that the refined files are self-contained and 
  developers don't need to go back to the research folder 
  to understand context or implementation details. This 
  would make the refined files more actionable and 
  complete.

  I should add this note to the refinement.md file, and 
  the best place would probably be in the DELIVERABLES 
  section or as a final note to emphasize this important 
  requirement.

✻ Thinking…

  Yes, that's a very good point. I should add a note about
   making each file self-contained with all necessary 
  research context. The best place would be either in the 
  DELIVERABLES section or as an additional bullet point at
   the end. I think adding it to the final execution 
  criteria at the end would be most effective since that's
   where the key requirements are listed.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I've added the requirement for self-contained 
  completeness at the end. This ensures that each refined 
  file will be a complete, standalone document with all 
  the necessary research context and implementation 
  details embedded within it. This makes the refined files
   much more valuable and actionable for developers.

● Perfect addition! Added the self-contained completeness
  requirement at the end, ensuring each refined file
  embeds all necessary research insights and technical
  context so developers won't need to reference the
  original research folder.

       82    Execute this refinement process with 
            meticulous attention to:

● Added a comprehensive VERTICAL SLICING APPROACH section
  to the refinement.md command, incorporating key
  principles from the research:

  - End-to-End Value: Complete functionality across all
  layers
  - INVEST Criteria: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable,
  Estimable, Small, Testable
  - Feature-Based Organization: Structure around features,
   not technical layers
  - Cross-Functional Delivery: Enable autonomous team
  execution
  - Minimal Viable Slices: Smallest units that still
  deliver user value
  - Parallel Development: Support concurrent team work
  - Testable Increments: Independent testing and
  deployment
  - User-Centric Focus: Value-based prioritization

  This ensures the refinement command will apply vertical
  slicing best practices when breaking down user stories.

> Who typically creates a PRD during the agile process?

● In agile processes, PRDs (Product Requirements
  Documents) are typically created by Product Managers or 
  Product Owners, though the approach varies
  significantly:

  Traditional PRD Authors:
  - Product Managers - Most common in larger organizations
  - Product Owners - In Scrum teams, often the designated
  role
  - Business Analysts - In some enterprise environments

  Agile Variations:
  - Many agile teams avoid traditional PRDs entirely,
  preferring:
    - User stories with acceptance criteria
    - Epics and features in tools like Jira
    - Collaborative documentation (wikis, shared docs)
    - Living documentation that evolves

  Collaborative Approach:
  - Product Owner/Manager initiates
  - Engineering leads provide technical input
  - UX/UI designers contribute user experience
  requirements
  - Stakeholders review and refine

  Key Difference: Agile favors lightweight, iterative 
  documentation over comprehensive upfront PRDs. The focus
   shifts from detailed specifications to collaborative
  understanding and rapid feedback loops.

> Can you or agents use claude code commands?

● Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sla
       sh-commands)
  ⎿  Received 2.1MB (200 OK)

● Yes, both I and the specialized agents can use Claude
  Code slash commands!

  What we can do:
  - Execute custom commands created in .claude/commands/
  - Use $ARGUMENTS for dynamic input
  - Access all allowed tools specified in command
  frontmatter
  - Chain commands and integrate them into workflows

  How I typically use them:
  - Through the Task tool - I can instruct agents to
  execute specific slash commands
  - Direct execution - I can follow command prompts and
  use the specified tools
  - Command chaining - Combine multiple commands in
  sequences

  Example: When you used /research vertical slicing, I
  executed it through the Task tool, which:
  1. Read the research.md command file
  2. Followed its ULTRATHINK methodology
  3. Used WebSearch for research
  4. Created the comprehensive document

  Limitations:
  - Commands must have proper allowed-tools configuration
  - I need appropriate permissions for the tools the
  command uses
  - Complex workflows might require agent coordination

  The commands you've created (like /research and
  /refinement) are fully usable by both me and specialized
   agents.
