# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves bootstrapping a new Expo React Native application with web support for the Asheron's Call Idler game. The application will serve as the foundation for a fun tap-to-attack idle game that delivers explosive number growth and satisfying visual feedback while preserving Asheron's Call's deep character customization system across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a new Expo project with TypeScript support, so that I can build a type-safe cross-platform application for the fun idle game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the project THEN the system SHALL use the latest Expo CLI with TypeScript template
2. WHEN the project is created THEN it SHALL include proper TypeScript configuration files with strict settings
3. WHEN the project is initialized THEN it SHALL support iOS, Android, and web platforms
4. IF the project creation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install essential dependencies for reactive state management and high-performance storage, so that I can implement the game's tap combat mechanics and instant visual feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include Legend-state (@beta) for reactive state management
2. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include MMKV for high-performance local storage
3. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include Expo Router for navigation
4. WHEN installing dependencies THEN the system SHALL include all required Expo modules for cross-platform support

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure development tools and code quality standards, so that I can maintain consistent code quality throughout the fun game development.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development tools THEN the system SHALL configure ESLint with TypeScript support
2. WHEN setting up development tools THEN the system SHALL configure Prettier for code formatting
3. WHEN setting up development tools THEN the system SHALL configure Jest for unit testing
4. WHEN setting up development tools THEN the system SHALL include React Native Testing Library

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to establish the project structure following vertical slicing principles, so that tap combat and progression features can be developed independently and maintainably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the project structure THEN the system SHALL create a src/ directory for source code
2. WHEN creating the project structure THEN the system SHALL create feature-based directories under src/features/
3. WHEN creating the project structure THEN the system SHALL create a shared/ directory for common utilities and visual effects
4. WHEN creating the project structure THEN the system SHALL follow the naming conventions specified in the structure guidelines

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure Expo for optimal development workflow, so that I can efficiently develop and test the tap-to-attack game across platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring Expo THEN the system SHALL set up app.json with proper configuration for all target platforms
2. WHEN configuring Expo THEN the system SHALL configure Metro bundler for optimal performance
3. WHEN configuring Expo THEN the system SHALL set up development scripts in package.json
4. WHEN configuring Expo THEN the system SHALL ensure web support is properly enabled

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create a basic app entry point and navigation structure, so that I can verify the application runs correctly and can display the tap combat interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the app entry point THEN the system SHALL create a functional root layout component
2. WHEN creating the app entry point THEN the system SHALL set up basic tab navigation structure
3. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL display a welcome screen on all platforms
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL demonstrate that TypeScript compilation works correctly

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a player, I want to tap creatures to deal damage with immediate visual feedback, so that I feel the satisfying impact of each attack and want to keep tapping.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tapping a creature THEN the system SHALL calculate and display damage numbers immediately
2. WHEN tapping consecutively THEN the system SHALL build combo multipliers (10 taps = 2x, 50 taps = 5x, 100 taps = 10x)
3. WHEN dealing critical hits THEN the system SHALL trigger screen shake and particle effects
4. WHEN not actively tapping THEN the system SHALL continue auto-attacking at reduced effectiveness
5. WHEN numbers grow large THEN the system SHALL format them with appropriate suffixes (K, M, B, T)

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see exponential number growth and satisfying progression feedback, so that I feel increasingly powerful over time and experience constant dopamine delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN leveling up THEN damage, gold, and experience SHALL scale exponentially (not linearly)
2. WHEN investing in attributes THEN each point SHALL provide +10% bonuses to relevant systems
3. WHEN achieving milestones THEN the system SHALL display celebration effects and visual feedback
4. WHEN numbers increase THEN they SHALL pulse, glow, or animate to draw attention
5. WHEN reaching significant thresholds THEN the system SHALL trigger satisfying reward ceremonies
