# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Initialize Expo project and verify basic functionality

  - Create new Expo project using latest CLI with TypeScript template
  - Install essential dependencies: Legend-state (@beta), MMKV, Expo Router
  - Test that the default app runs on all platforms (iOS, Android, web)
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

- [x] 2. Create character creation screens with visual design system

  - **Reference**: Follow `experiments/DESIGN_REFERENCE.md` for HTML/CSS to React Native implementation
  - **Visual Reference**: Use `experiments/attribute-screen.html` and `experiments/skill-screen.html` for design
  - Set up design system with colors, typography, and component patterns from reference
  - Create AttributeScreen component with profession selection and attribute sliders
  - Create SkillScreen component with skill categories and interactive adjustment
  - Implement custom slider components and diamond-shaped icons as specified in design reference
  - Configure app.json with proper app name and basic platform settings
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3_

- [x] 3. Implement character creation screen with state management

  - Create character feature directory with CharacterCreationScreen component
  - Implement Legend-state store for character data (name, basic stats)
  - Add navigation from welcome screen to character creation
  - Create form inputs for character name and display current state
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 4.1, 4.2, 6.2_

- [x] 4. Add character persistence with MMKV storage

  - Integrate MMKV with Legend-state for character data persistence
  - Implement save/load functionality for character state
  - Add logic to restore character data when app restarts
  - Test that character data persists across app restarts on all platforms
  - _Requirements: 2.2, 4.3_

- [x] 5. Create character sheet display screen

  - Build CharacterSheetScreen that displays saved character information
  - Add tab navigation between character creation and character sheet
  - Display character name, creation date, and basic placeholder stats
  - Implement navigation flow: welcome → character creation → character sheet
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 4.2_

- [x] 6. Add tap-to-attack combat system with visual feedback

  - Implement tap-to-attack mechanics with immediate damage calculation
  - Create creature display that responds to taps with damage numbers
  - Add combo system that builds multipliers with consecutive taps
  - Show explosive visual feedback (screen shake, particles, growing numbers)
  - Implement auto-attack system that continues when not actively tapping
  - _Requirements: 7.1, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 2.1_

- [ ] 7. Configure development tools and code quality

  - Set up ESLint and Prettier configuration for consistent code formatting
  - Add development scripts to package.json for linting and type checking
  - Configure TypeScript with strict settings and path mapping
  - Ensure all existing code passes linting and type checking
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 1.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Implement exponential progression and number formatting

  - Add exponential scaling formulas for damage, gold, and experience
  - Create number formatting system for large values (K, M, B, T notation)
  - Implement attribute-based bonuses (+10% per point system)
  - Add visual celebration effects for level ups and milestones
  - Create satisfying progression feedback with pulsing numbers and effects
  - _Requirements: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4, 8.5_

- [ ] 9. Add basic testing for core functionality
  - Install and configure Jest with React Native Testing Library
  - Write tests for character creation and state persistence
  - Create tests for tap combat mechanics and number scaling
  - Verify all tests pass and can run on CI/CD systems
  - _Requirements: 3.3, 3.4_
