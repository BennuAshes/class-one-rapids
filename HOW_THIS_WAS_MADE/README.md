# What Actually Happened: Development Timeline

AI generated based on convos and git history

## 1. Early Exploration

- Initial research and PRD generation concepts explored
- Git commit: "generate-prd and generate-technical-spec in place, though tech-spec needs work at the very least"
- Git commit: "research on knowledge graphs and recovered agents folder"
- Early experimentation with research compression and validation commands
- Git commit: "better research compression, validation command for research. needs better runbook?"
- Git commit: "great /reflect command and some experimenting with research"

## 2. Various Conversations

- Conversations about Expo SDK 54, game design, and project structure
- Research documents created with timestamps indicating work on:
  - PRD guides and best practices
  - Claude Code commands design patterns
  - Technical implementation guides
- Git commit: "v2 - quick save before redoing tech design doc/task generation"
- Not a linear, phase-based progression but exploratory work across multiple areas

## 3. Bulk Creation Day

- **Massive file creation event**: Most commands and initial specs created on the same day
- **Commands created simultaneously**:
  - `design.md`, `prd.md`, `next-feature.md`
  - `reflect-bug.md`, `reflect-convo.md`
  - `research.md`, `research-technical.md`
- **Research documents** (all created same day despite filenames suggesting different dates):
  - `claude_code_commands_guide_*.md`
  - `expo_legend_state_v3_guide_*.md`
  - `llm_task_description_guide_*.md`
  - `prd_guide_*.md`
  - `react_native_testing_library_guide_*.md`
  - `technical_design_doc_guide_*.md`
- **Game research documents**:
  - `asherons-call-gameplay-mechanics-research.md`
  - `asheron-call-idler-prd.md`
  - `idler-clicker-games-best-practices-*.md`
  - `asherons-call-idler-mvp.md`
  - `traditional-fun-game-design-report-*.md`
- **Initial feature specifications**:
  - `core-combat-tap-mechanic-feature-description.md`
  - `player-power-progression.md`
  - Multiple PRD, TDD, and task files for these features

## 4. Refinements and Recent Work
  - `tasks.md` command created
  - Git commit: "resolved some 'lessons' learned by reflection by updating command directly and moving content out of claude.md"
  - `weakness-critical-system.md` and related specs
  - `add-docs.md` and `refactor.md` commands
  - Git commit: "offline mode back, weakness spot working (minimally). some analysis and add-docs, refactor etc commands I'm experimenting with"
  - `simplified-attributes.md` and related specs
  - `next-feature-full-flow.md` command
  - `execute-task.md` command
  - Additional research: AI agent evaluation best practices
  - Additional research: Claude Code hooks

## Key Observations

- **Not a linear progression**: Commands and research were created in bulk, not through iterative phases
- **Real pattern**: Exploratory work → Consolidation event → Incremental additions
