# Information Types in Technical Documentation for LLM Agents

*Analysis Date: January 2025*  
*Case Study: expo-eslint-prettier-setup.md*

## Executive Summary

This analysis breaks down the types of information present in technical documentation and evaluates their usefulness for LLM agents during planning and code execution tasks. Understanding these information types helps optimize documentation for AI-assisted development workflows.

## Information Type Taxonomy

### 1. Direct Action Information (Highest Value for Execution)

**Definition**: Concrete, executable content that can be used directly without interpretation.

**Examples**:
- Exact Commands: `npx expo lint`, `npx eslint . --fix`
- Code Snippets: Configuration files that can be copied verbatim
- Package Names with Versions: `eslint-config-expo@9.2.0`
- File Paths: `.vscode/settings.json`, `eslint.config.js`

**LLM Utility**: 
- **Planning**: Medium - Helps identify concrete steps
- **Execution**: Critical - Can be used directly in implementation
- **Error Recovery**: High - Provides exact solutions

### 2. Conditional Decision Logic (Critical for Planning)

**Definition**: Rules and conditions that determine which path to take based on context.

**Examples**:
- Version-Specific Behaviors: "SDK 53+ vs SDK 52 differences"
- Workarounds: "If SDK 52, use `npx eslint . --fix` instead"
- Compatibility Matrices: Which configs work with which versions
- Error-Solution Pairs: "Issue: X → Solution: Y"

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: Critical - Determines execution strategy
- **Execution**: High - Prevents errors before they occur
- **Error Recovery**: Critical - Provides fallback paths

### 3. Context & Rationale (Helps with Decision Making)

**Definition**: Explanations of why certain approaches are preferred.

**Examples**:
- "Why This is Simplest": Justifications for approach selection
- Trade-offs: "Official presets over custom" with reasoning
- Performance Considerations: "Flat config vs legacy impact"

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: High - Helps select optimal approach
- **Execution**: Low - Not directly actionable
- **Error Recovery**: Medium - Helps understand root causes

### 4. Validation & Verification (Essential for Quality Assurance)

**Definition**: Methods to confirm successful implementation.

**Examples**:
- Test Commands: `npm list eslint-config-expo`, `npx prettier --check .`
- Expected Outcomes: What success looks like
- Checklists: Step-by-step verification items

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: Medium - Defines success criteria
- **Execution**: Critical - Confirms correct implementation
- **Error Recovery**: High - Identifies what went wrong

### 5. Meta-Information (Lowest Priority for Execution)

**Definition**: Contextual information about the documentation itself.

**Examples**:
- Research Date: "Research conducted August 2025"
- External References: Documentation links
- Community Resources: Where to find help

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: Low - Rarely affects decisions
- **Execution**: Minimal - Not actionable
- **Error Recovery**: Low - Only useful for escalation

### 6. Structural Patterns (Useful for Complex Tasks)

**Definition**: Organizational patterns that guide multi-step processes.

**Examples**:
- Step-by-Step Processes: Numbered implementation steps
- Prerequisites: "Ensure you're in your Expo project directory"
- Dependencies Between Steps: Step 2 must complete before Step 3

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: Critical - Defines execution order
- **Execution**: High - Prevents sequence errors
- **Error Recovery**: Medium - Helps identify missed steps

### 7. Preventive Knowledge (Time/Error Savings)

**Definition**: Information that helps avoid common problems.

**Examples**:
- Common Pitfalls: Known issues to avoid
- Best Practices: IDE integration settings
- Anti-patterns: What NOT to do (implicit in "simplest" approach)

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: High - Shapes approach selection
- **Execution**: Medium - Prevents common mistakes
- **Error Recovery**: Low - More about prevention

### 8. Integration Information (Ecosystem Compatibility)

**Definition**: How components work together in larger systems.

**Examples**:
- IDE Configurations: VS Code extensions and settings
- Team Workflow: npm scripts for consistency
- Tool Interactions: How ESLint, Prettier, and Expo work together

**LLM Utility**:
- **Planning**: Medium - Affects tool selection
- **Execution**: High - Ensures compatibility
- **Error Recovery**: Medium - Helps diagnose integration issues

## Optimization Recommendations for LLM Documentation

### Priority 1: Must Have
1. **Exact executable commands** with clear context
2. **Conditional logic** for version/environment differences
3. **Validation commands** to confirm success
4. **Clear step sequencing** with dependencies

### Priority 2: Should Have
1. **Known issues with solutions**
2. **File paths and package names**
3. **Expected outputs** for validation
4. **Integration requirements**

### Priority 3: Nice to Have
1. **Rationale for decisions**
2. **Performance considerations**
3. **Best practices**
4. **Alternative approaches**

### Priority 4: Optional
1. **Historical context**
2. **External references**
3. **Community resources**
4. **Meta-information**

## Practical Application

### For Task Generation (PRD → Technical Spec)
**Most Valuable**:
- Conditional decision trees
- Structural patterns
- Validation criteria

### For Code Implementation
**Most Valuable**:
- Direct action information
- Exact commands and code
- File paths and configurations

### For Debugging
**Most Valuable**:
- Error-solution pairs
- Validation commands
- Integration information

## Conclusion

Technical documentation for LLM agents should prioritize actionable, conditional, and validatable information. Meta-information and explanatory content, while valuable for human understanding, can be minimized in LLM-optimized documentation. The ideal structure follows a hierarchy from executable commands through conditional logic to validation criteria, with rationale and context as supporting rather than primary elements.
