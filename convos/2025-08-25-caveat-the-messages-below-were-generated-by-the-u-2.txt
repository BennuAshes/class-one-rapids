features too

● I'll help you generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an Expo app
   foundation. Let me start by reading the PRD template and then creating a
  comprehensive requirements document.

     # Product Requirements Document: Expo App Foundation
     ## Introduction
     This document outlines the requirements for establishing a foundational
     Expo React Native application that serves as a scalable starting point for
      feature development. The app will provide essential infrastructure
     including navigation, state management, and development tooling while
     maintaining cross-platform compatibility for iOS, Android, and web
     platforms.
     ### Business Context
     Building a solid foundation for mobile application development accelerates
      time-to-market for new features while ensuring consistent user
     experiences across platforms. A well-structured Expo app foundation
     reduces technical debt, improves developer productivity, and provides a
     reliable base for iterative feature development.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read PRD template                   
     ☒ Generate PRD for Expo app foundation
     ☒ Save PRD document

● PRD created successfully at PRD-expo-app-foundation.md. The document defines
   5 core requirements for building a robust Expo app foundation:

  1. Cross-Platform Setup - TypeScript-enabled app running on iOS, Android,
  and web
  2. Navigation Infrastructure - Tab and stack navigation system
  3. State Management - Configured state solution with persistence
  4. Development Environment - Linting, formatting, and testing tools
  5. Component Library - Reusable UI components with theming support

  Each requirement includes clear acceptance criteria and the document
  specifies measurable success metrics focused on developer productivity and
  code quality.

● I'll generate a technical specification from the PRD for the Expo app
  foundation, focusing on actionable tasks that can be easily parsed and
  executed.

     # Technical Specification: Expo App Foundation
     ## Quick Summary
     Build a production-ready Expo React Native application foundation with
     TypeScript, navigation, state management, and development tooling that
     runs on iOS, Android, and web platforms.
     ## Implementation Tasks
     ### Requirement: Cross-Platform Application Setup
     **User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured Expo application with
     TypeScript support, so that I can build type-safe features across iOS,
     Android, and web platforms.

     ☒ Generate technical specification
     ☒ Save technical specification document

● Technical specification created at TECH-SPEC-expo-app-foundation.md. The
  spec breaks down the PRD into 30+ actionable tasks across 5 requirements,
  with clear checkboxes for tracking. Each requirement includes specific
  technical tasks, acceptance tests, and definition of done criteria. The
  development is organized into 3 phases over approximately 10 days.
