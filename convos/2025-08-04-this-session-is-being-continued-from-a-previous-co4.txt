  Based on the context provided, I need to continue with the last task that was being worked on. 
  From the summary, the user's last request was:

  /create-command-advanced Command that follows a runbook using the role/persona at 
  roles/senior-software-engineer.md - an example of a runbook is located at 
  projects/pet-software-idler/petsoft-tycoon-implementation-runbook.md

  I was in the process of creating an advanced command that follows runbooks using the senior 
  software engineer persona. I've already read:
  1. /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/roles/senior-software-engineer.md - the senior software engineer
   persona
  2. /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md - 
  task decomposition research 
  3. /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/research/planning/vertical-slicing.md - vertical slicing 
  research

  Now I need to also read the example runbook to understand the structure, then create the 
  advanced command that can follow runbooks using the senior engineer persona.

  Looking at the todo list, it shows that all the runbook creation tasks are completed, which 
  aligns with the summary indicating that a comprehensive implementation runbook was already 
  created for the PetSoft Tycoon project.

  Now I need to read the example runbook and then create the advanced command.

● Continuing with creating the advanced command for following runbooks using the senior software
  engineer persona. Let me read the example runbook to understand the structure.

  Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the task. I need to create an advanced command that
   can follow runbooks using the senior software engineer persona. Based on the files I've read:

  1. Senior Software Engineer Role: Focus on technical excellence, test-driven development, code 
  quality, and mentoring approach
  2. Example Runbook: A comprehensive 2600+ line implementation guide for PetSoft Tycoon with 
  detailed tasks, phases, and step-by-step instructions
  3. Task Decomposition Research: Principles for breaking down complex work into manageable 
  components using cognitive psychology insights
  4. Vertical Slicing: Feature-focused development approach for end-to-end functionality

  The command should:
  - Take a runbook as input
  - Follow the senior software engineer persona (test-driven development, high code quality, 
  technical excellence)
  - Execute runbook tasks systematically
  - Apply the persona's development approach (understand requirements thoroughly, write tests 
  first, optimize for readability, etc.)
  - Use structured task decomposition principles
  - Provide technical guidance and decision-making

  Let me create this advanced command.

● Now I'll create the advanced command that can follow runbooks using the senior software
  engineer persona.

     # Follow Runbook with Senior Software Engineer
     **Description**: Execute runbook tasks using senior software engineer expertise and
     methodology
     ## Overview
     This command processes implementation runbooks and executes them using the technical
     approach, quality standards, and development practices of an experienced Senior Software
     Engineer. It applies test-driven development, systematic problem-solving, and technical
     excellence principles while following structured task decomposition methodologies.

  Great! I've successfully created the advanced command for following runbooks using the senior 
  software engineer persona. The command integrates:

  1. Senior Software Engineer Approach: 
    - Test-driven development
    - Technical excellence focus
    - Systematic problem solving
    - Quality standards and best practices
    - Performance optimization
  2. Runbook Execution Framework:
    - Phase-by-phase systematic execution
    - Task validation and success criteria checking
    - Dependency management
    - Quality checkpoints
    - Continuous integration
  3. Structured Task Decomposition:
    - Cognitive optimization (Miller's 7±2 rule)
    - Hierarchical organization
    - Atomic actionability
    - Context-dependent adaptation
  4. Advanced Features:
    - Intelligent task scheduling
    - Adaptive execution with error recovery
    - Technical excellence integration
    - Performance monitoring and quality metrics

  The command is comprehensive and provides:
  - Detailed usage instructions with examples
  - Expected runbook structure requirements
  - Quality assurance integration
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms
  - Integration with development workflows
  - Success metrics and monitoring

  This completes the task that was requested. The command can now be used to execute runbooks 
  with the technical expertise and methodology of a senior software engineer, following the 
  structured approach demonstrated in the example PetSoft Tycoon implementation runbook.

● I've successfully created the advanced command /follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer that
  combines the technical expertise of a Senior Software Engineer with systematic runbook
  execution.

  Key Features Created:

  🧠 Senior Engineer Methodology
  - Test-driven development approach with comprehensive testing strategies
  - Technical excellence focus (clean code, SOLID principles, security best practices)
  - Systematic problem-solving with thorough requirement analysis
  - Quality standards enforcement with continuous validation

  📋 Structured Runbook Execution
  - Phase-by-phase systematic progression through implementation tasks
  - Intelligent task scheduling with dependency resolution
  - Success criteria validation and quality checkpoints
  - Adaptive execution with error recovery capabilities

  ⚡ Advanced Capabilities
  - Cognitive load optimization using Miller's 7±2 rule for task chunking
  - Parallel task execution where dependencies allow
  - Performance monitoring and benchmarking integration
  - Automated quality assurance with linting, testing, and security scanning

  🛠️ Development Workflow Integration
  - Version control integration with meaningful commit messages
  - CI/CD pipeline support with automated testing
  - Documentation generation and knowledge sharing
  - Code review processes and best practices enforcement

  The command can execute complete runbooks like the PetSoft Tycoon example, applying
  senior-level engineering practices while maintaining the systematic approach needed for complex
   multi-week projects. It emphasizes both delivery excellence and educational value, documenting
   decisions and sharing knowledge throughout the implementation process.
