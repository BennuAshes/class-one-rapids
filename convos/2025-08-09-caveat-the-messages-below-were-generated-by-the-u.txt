● Based on analyzing your system, here are technical simplification ideas focusing
  on constraints and complexity:

  Critical Technical Constraints Identified

  1. Token Limit Management - Complex chunked output system
  2. Research Validation Overhead - Every package/pattern checked against research
  files
  3. Manual Directory Navigation - Must cd projects/{name}/ before commands
  4. Complex Architecture Validation - Real-time pattern checking with
  auto-corrections
  5. Multiple File Generation - 6+ markdown files per runbook

  Technical Simplification Ideas

  1. Token Management Simplification

  - Single-pass generation: Generate entire runbook in one pass, let user split
  manually if needed
  - Template-based approach: Pre-built templates with placeholders vs dynamic
  generation
  - Size-aware generation: Check PRD size first, choose simple vs chunked approach

  2. Research Integration Simplification

  - Research cache: Build one master research.json file, validate against cache vs
  scanning files
  - Version pinning file: Simple versions.json with package→version mapping
  - Optional research: Make research validation opt-in vs mandatory

  3. Directory Management Simplification

  - Auto-detection: Commands detect project root automatically
  - Relative path support: Work from any directory, resolve paths automatically
  - Workspace concept: Set project once, all commands remember

  4. Architecture Validation Simplification

  - Validation-only mode: Check patterns but don't auto-correct
  - Warning-based: Show warnings vs failing/correcting automatically
  - Pattern templates: Pre-built folder structures vs dynamic validation

  5. File Generation Simplification

  - Single runbook option: Offer choice between phased vs single file
  - Minimal mode: Generate only essential files (analysis + tasks)
  - Progressive enhancement: Start simple, add complexity if needed

  6. Command Flow Simplification

  - Combine commands: Merge PRD analysis + runbook generation into one step
  - Smart defaults: Fewer parameters, more intelligent defaults
  - Skip validation: Option to skip research validation for speed

  Proposed Simplified Flow

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to think deeper and longer about the research.json plan. Let
   me really dive deep into this idea and explore all the implications, benefits, 
  challenges, and implementation details.

  Current Research System Analysis

  First, let me understand what the current system does:

  1. Current Research Structure: The system has research/ folder with:
    - research/tech/*.md files (expo.md, react-native.md, solid.md, etc.)
    - research/planning/*.md files (vertical-slicing.md, etc.)
    - research/agentic/*.md files
  2. Current Research Usage: When commands run, they:
    - Scan ALL research/tech/*.md files looking for package references
    - Extract package versions/tags from markdown content
    - Search for architecture patterns
    - Validate every install command against found research
    - Auto-correct package versions to match research
  3. Current Problems:
    - File scanning is expensive (I/O overhead)
    - Parsing markdown for structured data is fragile
    - No caching - rescans every time
    - Pattern matching is regex-based and error-prone
    - Version extraction logic is duplicated across commands
    - Research files can become stale without detection

  Deep Thinking on research.json Approach

  Core Concept

  Instead of scanning markdown files every time, pre-process all research into a 
  structured JSON index that can be quickly queried.

  Detailed Implementation Strategy

  1. Structure Design

  {
    "metadata": {
      "version": "1.0.0",
      "generated_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "source_hash": "abc123...",
      "generator_version": "1.2.3"
    },
    "packages": {
      "@legendapp/state": {
        "version": "@beta",
        "source_file": "research/tech/legend-state.md",
        "source_lines": [45, 67],
        "install_command": "npm install @legendapp/state@beta",
        "confidence": "high",
        "last_validated": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
        "notes": "Beta version required for React 18 compatibility",
        "alternatives": ["zustand", "valtio"],
        "deprecation_status": null
      },
      "react-native": {
        "version": "0.76+",
        "source_file": "research/tech/react-native.md", 
        "source_lines": [12, 23],
        "install_command": "npm install react-native@0.76"

  I'll continue the install command for react-native by copying over the next 
  thinking. The JSON structure provides a comprehensive, machine-readable way to 
  capture package research details. It includes metadata about the source, precise 
  version information, installation commands, and additional context like confidence
   levels and alternative options.

  The react-native configuration specifies a minimum version 0.76, with 
  platform-specific requirements for iOS and Android. Key observations include 
  breaking changes related to the new architecture and API updates.

  The vertical slicing pattern emphasizes feature-based organization, mandating that
   components and services be scoped within specific feature directories. The 
  recommended structure separates concerns into feature-specific and shared modules,
   ensuring cleaner, more modular code architecture.

  For state management, the approach involves breaking down monolithic state into 
  granular, feature-specific observables. This prevents complex, tightly-coupled 
  global state by allowing each feature to manage its own state independently, with 
  composition happening at the application level.

  The code example demonstrates this principle: individual feature states like 
  resources are defined separately, then composed into a top-level game state, 
  promoting better separation of concerns and easier maintenance. The compatibility 
  matrix reveals specific version constraints for react-native ecosystem 
  dependencies. Notably, react-native-reanimated has a version limitation below 
  3.0.0, which could impact project configuration. 

  Validation rules enforce precise package installation practices, mandating 
  specific beta versions for state management and recommending strict folder 
  organization strategies. The template suggests a comprehensive React Native 
  project setup integrating Expo and Legend State, emphasizing structured 
  development approaches.

  Deprecation tracking highlights critical migration paths, identifying outdated 
  packages like react-native-elements and recommending transitions to modern 
  alternatives. The guidelines systematically phase out older development patterns, 
  pushing developers toward functional component architectures and 
  community-supported libraries.

  I'll design a research scanning mechanism to automate this deprecation 
  intelligence gathering. The interface defines key methods for extracting package 
  metadata, identifying deprecated patterns, and generating comprehensive 
  compatibility insights across project configurations.

  The scanning algorithm will traverse research documentation, processing markdown 
  files to build a comprehensive index of technological transitions and recommended 
  upgrade paths. By hashing file contents, I can efficiently track changes and 
  extract structured migration intelligence.

  For each research file, I'll systematically extract package references, 
  architectural patterns, and underlying technologies. These insights get 
  meticulously indexed with precise provenance tracking - capturing file origin, 
  content hash, and extraction timestamp. The process culminates in generating 
  advanced derivative artifacts like compatibility matrices, validation rules, and 
  migration templates.

  The incremental update mechanism introduces a sophisticated change detection 
  strategy. I'll design an interface that can track file modifications, computing a 
  comprehensive changeset identifying added, modified, deleted, and unchanged 
  research artifacts. This enables surgical, efficient index updates without 
  unnecessary full reprocessing.

  The update algorithm will intelligently assess detected changes, determining 
  whether a full reindex is required or targeted incremental updates can suffice. By
   tracking file hashes and comparing against the existing research index, I can 
  optimize computational resources and maintain data integrity.

  When changes are detected, the system will selectively process only modified or 
  newly added files. Deleted files get removed from the index, while updated content
   triggers precise data extraction and index refreshing. The approach ensures 
  minimal computational overhead while keeping the research index current and 
  accurate.

  The method culminates in regenerating derived data exclusively for sections 
  impacted by the detected changes, further enhancing performance and maintaining a 
  lean, responsive research indexing mechanism.

  The query interface provides robust package and pattern research capabilities. 
  Developers can retrieve specific package versions, validate installation commands,
   and explore comprehensive package metadata through intuitive method calls. The 
  design enables precise, context-aware package information retrieval with built-in 
  validation mechanisms.

  Usage demonstrates retrieving package details like version and source file, along 
  with intelligent installation command validation that suggests corrections when 
  needed. The pattern query similarly supports retrieving architectural patterns and
   validating project folder structures against predefined guidelines.

  Performance analysis reveals significant optimization through indexing. By 
  transitioning from file scanning to a pre-computed JSON index, lookup times 
  dramatically improve from O(n×m) to O(1), reducing command execution time from 
  hundreds of milliseconds to near-instantaneous operations.

  The validation framework introduces multi-layered integrity checks, tracking 
  provenance metadata and ensuring comprehensive system reliability through syntax, 
  semantic, source, and compatibility assessments.

  I'm designing a hybrid migration approach that progressively transitions research 
  data management. The strategy involves incremental system updates, starting with 
  parallel index generation and gradually phasing out traditional file scanning 
  methods. This approach ensures minimal disruption while introducing more efficient
   research data retrieval mechanisms.

  The migration plan includes graceful fallback strategies, maintaining backwards 
  compatibility through flexible command interfaces and automatic index regeneration
   capabilities. By implementing smart transition phases, the system can smoothly 
  evolve without breaking existing workflows.

  Advanced features like conflict resolution, dependency graph analysis, and 
  template generation will enhance the research data management system's 
  intelligence and adaptability. These capabilities will provide more nuanced 
  insights into package interactions, project structures, and potential 
  compatibility challenges.

  The error handling strategy focuses on robust recovery mechanisms, particularly 
  around index corruption scenarios. This ensures system resilience and prevents 
  potential data retrieval failures during research operations.

  I'll design a comprehensive recovery interface that supports multiple strategies 
  for maintaining index integrity, from lightweight repairs to complete regeneration
   when necessary.

  The approach allows partial index support, enabling graceful handling of parsing 
  failures by marking problematic sections for manual review while preserving usable
   research data.

  CLI tooling provides granular management capabilities, supporting generation, 
  updating, querying, and debugging of research indexes through intuitive 
  command-line interfaces. These tools enable precise package exploration, conflict 
  checking, and source verification.

  IDE integration enhances developer productivity by leveraging research metadata 
  for intelligent suggestions, architecture validation, template generation, and 
  real-time conflict detection directly within development environments.

  The proposed system delivers substantial performance improvements, reducing 
  validation times by orders of magnitude and enabling constant-time lookups. It 
  introduces robust reliability mechanisms that centralize research tracking, 
  minimize parsing errors, and facilitate explicit version control of research 
  documentation.

  Maintenance becomes significantly more transparent, with automated change 
  detection, impact analysis, and quality control mechanisms built directly into the
   research indexing workflow. Developers gain unprecedented visibility into 
  research evolution and system-wide implications of documentation modifications.

  Challenges around index generation and maintenance are systematically addressed 
  through automated detection strategies, including hash-based change tracking, git 
  hooks, staleness warnings, and comprehensive CI/CD validation processes.

  The data model's complexity is carefully managed by implementing incremental 
  parsing approaches. Starting with simple extraction patterns and developing 
  extensive test suites ensures robust markdown-to-structured-data conversion. 
  Manual review capabilities and gradual migration strategies provide flexibility 
  during implementation.

  Schema evolution is proactively handled through explicit versioning, dedicated 
  migration tools, backwards compatibility layers, and runtime validation. This 
  approach ensures the research index remains adaptable while maintaining structural
   integrity.

  The source of truth remains unambiguous, with markdown files serving as the 
  primary reference point and research.json functioning as a generated, 
  supplementary artifact. Clear documentation and synchronization tooling prevent 
  potential confusion.

  Initial implementation focuses on establishing a minimal viable product, 
  generating basic research.json structures from package metadata with 
  straightforward parsing logic.

  Subsequent phases progressively enhance the system's capabilities, introducing 
  advanced pattern recognition, validation rule generation, and comprehensive CLI 
  tooling. The solution emphasizes incremental development, enabling sophisticated 
  research management through structured data extraction and intelligent processing.

> How can we avoid losing research insights condensing the data into a json file?

● Excellent question. Converting rich markdown research into structured JSON risks
  losing the contextual insights, rationale, and nuanced understanding that makes
  research valuable. Here's how to preserve research insights:

  The Core Problem

  # Current research (rich context)
  Legend State's @beta version is crucial for React 18 concurrent features.
  The stable version lacks proper batching support, causing performance issues
  in games with rapid state updates. I tested both versions extensively on
  the PetSoft project - beta showed 40% better performance on resource updates.

  Avoid the temptation to use Zustand here - it works but requires more
  boilerplate for our nested game state patterns.

  vs

  {
    "@legendapp/state": {
      "version": "@beta",
      "reason": "React 18 compatibility"
    }
  }

  Lost: Context, testing experience, performance data, alternatives analysis,
  warnings

  Solution: Hybrid Approach - JSON + Rich Context

  1. Preserve Full Context with References

  {
    "@legendapp/state": {
      "version": "@beta",
      "source_file": "research/tech/legend-state.md",
      "source_lines": [45, 67],
      "context": {

        "why_not_alternatives": "requires more boilerplate for nested state",
        "performance_data": "40% better on resource updates"
      },
      "full_context_excerpt": "Legend State's @beta version is crucial for React 
  18..."
    }
  }

  2. Preserve Research Narratives

    "research_narratives": {
      "legend-state-decision": {
        "title": "Why Legend State @beta for Game Development",
        "full_text": "...complete markdown section...",
        "key_insights": [
          "React 18 concurrent rendering compatibility",

        "trade_offs": ["Beta stability risk vs performance gains"]
      }
    }
  }

  3. Multi-Layer Information Architecture

  {
    "packages": {
      "@legendapp/state": {
        // Quick lookup data (for speed)
        "version": "@beta",
        "confidence": "high",

        // Rich context (for understanding)
        "research_story": {
          "discovery_process": "Compared 5 state libraries over 2 weeks",
          "testing_methodology": "Built resource system prototypes with each",

        "source_markdown": "...complete original markdown section...",
        "related_discussions": ["State management architecture decisions"]
      }
    }
  }

  4. Preserve Research Methodology

  {
    "research_metadata": {
      "methodology": {
        "testing_approach": "Build prototypes with each option",
        "evaluation_criteria": ["Performance", "DX", "Bundle size", "Type safety"],
        "decision_framework": "Weight performance > DX for idle games"
      },
      "research_sessions": [
        {
          "date": "2024-01-15",
          "focus": "State management comparison",
          "findings": "Legend State performs best for rapid updates",
          "confidence_level": "high",
          "follow_up_needed": "Test with larger state trees"
        }
      ]
    }
  }

  Implementation Strategy: Best of Both Worlds

          },
          "gotchas": ["Metro config needed", "Beta stability risk"],
          "source_excerpt": "...key paragraph from original research..."
        },

        // Full provenance
        "source": {
          "file": "research/tech/legend-state.md",
          "lines": [45, 67],
          "last_updated": "2024-01-15"
        }
      }
    }
  }

  Option 2: JSON + Markdown Links

  {
    "@legendapp/state": {
      "version": "@beta",
      "quick_reason": "Performance + React 18 compatibility",
      "full_context": "research/tech/legend-state.md#beta-version-analysis",
      "related_insights": [
        "research/tech/legend-state.md#performance-comparison",
        "research/tech/legend-state.md#alternatives-analysis"
      ]
    }
  }

  Option 3: Tiered Access Pattern

  // Fast lookup (for commands)
  const version = researchIndex.getPackageVersion('@legendapp/state');

  // Rich context (for understanding)  
  const insights = researchIndex.getPackageInsights('@legendapp/state');
  // Returns: rationale, testing data, alternatives, gotchas

  // Full research (for deep dive)
  const fullContext = researchIndex.getFullResearch('@legendapp/state');
  // Returns: complete markdown section, methodology, evolution

  Specific Preservation Strategies

  1. Decision Trees

  {
    "decision_trees": {
      "state_management_choice": {
        "criteria": ["performance", "dx", "bundle_size"],
        "options_evaluated": ["zustand", "redux", "legend-state", "valtio"],
        "decision_matrix": {
          "legend-state": { "performance": 9, "dx": 8, "bundle_size": 7 },
          "zustand": { "performance": 6, "dx": 9, "bundle_size": 9 }
        },
        "final_choice": "legend-state",
        "rationale": "Performance critical for idle games with rapid updates"
      }
    }
  }

  2. Learning Narratives

  {
    "learning_stories": {
      "legend-state-journey": {
        "discovery": "Found Legend State through React 18 performance research",
        "initial_skepticism": "Concerned about beta stability",
        "testing_process": "Built side-by-side prototypes with Zustand",
        "aha_moment": "40% performance improvement on resource updates",
        "adoption_decision": "Beta risk acceptable for performance gains",
        "lessons_learned": ["Test early, measure performance", "Beta can be 
  production-ready"]
      }
    }
  }

  3. Context-Aware Queries

  // Instead of just: getPackageVersion('@legendapp/state')
  // Rich context queries:

  researchQuery.getPackageDecision('@legendapp/state', {
    includeRationale: true,
    includeAlternatives: true,
    includeTestingData: true,
    includeGotchas: true
  });

  // Returns full decision context, not just version number

  Benefits of This Approach

  1. Speed: JSON structure for fast lookups
  2. Context: Full research insights preserved
  3. Traceability: Know exactly why each decision was made
  4. Evolution: Track how understanding developed over time
  5. Teaching: New developers can learn the reasoning
  6. Validation: Verify decisions against original context

  Implementation Priority

  1. Phase 1: Basic JSON with source references
  2. Phase 2: Add insight excerpts and key findings
  3. Phase 3: Full context preservation with narratives
  4. Phase 4: Rich query interfaces for context access

  The key is treating JSON as an index into rich research content, not a replacement
   for it. We get speed benefits while preserving all the valuable human insights
  that make research useful.

> What is calling a function in this example?

● I don't see a specific code example in your message. Could you please share the
  example you're referring to so I can identify what's calling the function?

> researchQuery.getPackageDecision('@legendapp/state', {
      includeRationale: true,
      includeAlternatives: true,
      includeTestingData: true,
      includeGotchas: true
    });

● In this example, the calling code/context is calling the function. Specifically:

  - What's calling: The code that contains this statement (could be a command,
  another function, or application logic)
  - Function being called: getPackageDecision()
  - Object: researchQuery (an instance of a ResearchQuery class)
  - Arguments:
    - '@legendapp/state' (package name)
    - Configuration object with boolean flags

  This is just a conceptual example I provided to illustrate how rich context
  queries could work in the research.json system. In the actual implementation, it
  might be called by:

  // Inside a command like create-development-runbook-v2.md
  const researchQuery = new ResearchQuery(researchIndex);
  const packageInfo = researchQuery.getPackageDecision('@legendapp/state', {
    includeRationale: true,
    includeAlternatives: true,
    includeTestingData: true,
    includeGotchas: true
  });

  // Or inside the follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer command
  const decision = researchQuery.getPackageDecision(packageName, options);

  Was there a specific aspect of the function call you wanted me to clarify?

> Does this actually working inside a claude code command?

● No, this doesn't actually work inside a Claude Code command currently.

  This was a conceptual example showing how the research.json system could work if
  implemented. Right now:

  Current Reality

  Claude Code commands use:
  - Markdown parsing with regex
  - File scanning with grep and Read tools
  - Basic string manipulation

  The Example Was Hypothetical

  // This doesn't exist yet - it was a design proposal
  researchQuery.getPackageDecision('@legendapp/state', {...});

  What Actually Works Now

  Inside Claude Code commands, you'd do:
  // Real current approach
  const researchContent = await readFile('research/tech/legend-state.md');
  const versionMatch = researchContent.match(/@legendapp\/state@(\w+)/);
  const version = versionMatch ? versionMatch[1] : null;

  To Make It Work

  You'd need to:
  1. Build the ResearchQuery class with actual TypeScript/JavaScript
  2. Generate the research.json file from existing markdown
  3. Integrate it into commands by importing/requiring the module
  4. Update command definitions to use the new system

  The example was showing the end goal of what the research.json system could
  enable, not something that works today.

  Should I clarify what currently works in your commands vs what would need to be
  built?

> I don't understand why my LLM system using markdown files is using typescript

● You're absolutely right - that's confusing! Let me clarify:

  Your LLM System Reality

  - Claude Code commands are markdown files with instructions
  - Claude (the LLM) reads markdown and executes using tools like Read, Grep, Bash
  - No TypeScript execution - Claude interprets and acts on the markdown content

  Why I Used TypeScript Examples

  I was incorrectly thinking about building traditional software components, when
  your system is actually:

  # Current working reality in your commands
  Read research/tech/legend-state.md
  Extract package version using pattern matching
  Use that version in npm install commands

  NOT:
  // This doesn't make sense in your context
  const version = researchQuery.getPackageVersion('@legendapp/state');

  What Actually Makes Sense for Your System

  Instead of a TypeScript class, you'd want:

  1. Pre-generated research.json (static file)
  2. Commands read the JSON using Read tool
  3. Claude parses JSON in memory and makes decisions

  # How it would actually work in your commands
  Read ./research-index.json
  Parse the JSON to find @legendapp/state version
  Use that version in npm install command

  The "research.json" idea is still valid, but the interface would be Claude reading
   static JSON files, not calling TypeScript methods.

  Does that make more sense for your LLM-based system?

> Keeping in mind that my whole intent is markdown files for an claude code, are 
  json files in this way the best way? Won't it end up being more tokens because of 
  the overhead of json? Are there other ways to handle passing large amounts of 
  research in a condensed way to an LLM, especially for claude? Do research and 
  think deeply, ultrathink

✻ Thinking…

  This is a really important question. The user is pointing out a fundamental issue 
  with my JSON proposal - they're using Claude Code (an LLM system) and markdown 
  files, and I suggested JSON which might actually be WORSE for token efficiency for
   LLMs.

  Let me think through this deeply:

  1. Token Efficiency Analysis
    - JSON has structural overhead: {"key": "value"} syntax
    - Markdown is more natural language, potentially more compressed for LLMs
    - LLMs like Claude are trained on natural language, not JSON primarily
    - JSON requires parsing overhead in the LLM's "mental" processing
  2. LLM Processing Efficiency
    - LLMs are better at understanding natural language patterns
    - Markdown research files are already in the "native" format for LLMs
    - JSON might actually require more cognitive overhead for the LLM to parse and 
  understand
    - The "semantic" richness of markdown is lost in JSON structure
  3. Alternative Approaches
  Let me think of better approaches:

  3. Option 1: Condensed Markdown Summaries
  Instead of full research files, create condensed research summaries that maintain 
  markdown format but are much shorter.

  3. Option 2: Structured Markdown Tables
  Use markdown tables for structured data - more LLM-friendly than JSON

  3. Option 3: Research Indices in Markdown
  Create markdown index files that summarize and point to full research

  3. Option 4: Hierarchical Research System
  Multiple levels of detail in markdown format

  3. Option 5: Template-based Research
  Standard markdown templates that compress information efficiently
  4. Token Analysis

  4. JSON version:
  {
    "packages": {
      "@legendapp/state": {
        "version": "@beta",
        "reason": "React 18 compatibility and performance",
        "source": "research/tech/legend-state.md",
        "alternatives": ["zustand", "valtio"],
        "confidence": "high"
      }
    }
  }
  4. This is probably ~50-70 tokens

  4. Markdown version:
  ## @legendapp/state
  - Version: @beta
  - Reason: React 18 compatibility and performance  
  - Source: research/tech/legend-state.md
  - Alternatives: zustand, valtio
  - Confidence: high
  4. This is probably ~30-40 tokens

  4. Or even more condensed:
  @legendapp/state@beta -

  I'm analyzing the token efficiency of different data representation formats, 
  focusing on how LLMs process information. The markdown approach clearly offers 
  significant advantages in terms of token compression and natural language 
  processing. By minimizing structural overhead and leveraging a format closer to 
  how LLMs are trained, we can create more efficient and readable research 
  documentation.

  The key insight is simplifying information representation while maintaining 
  semantic richness. Markdown provides a lightweight, intuitive way to capture 
  research details that aligns perfectly with how language models understand and 
  process information. Research reveals promising performance optimizations and 
  architectural strategies for modern React and React Native development. Key 
  packages like @legendapp/state demonstrate significant speed improvements, with 
  40% faster performance in React 18. Emerging patterns emphasize modular design 
  through vertical slicing and feature-oriented observable stores, moving away from 
  monolithic architectures.

  The research highlights compatibility considerations for cutting-edge frameworks, 
  including Expo 52+ and React Native 0.76, which introduce new architectural 
  requirements and performance enhancements. Developers should prioritize modular, 
  performance-driven approaches that leverage modern framework capabilities.

  Critical implementation guidelines mandate a structured project organization: 
  feature-specific components, decentralized state management, and custom hook-based
   logic patterns. These recommendations aim to create more maintainable, scalable 
  application architectures.

  The research system employs a layered approach with strategic information loading.
   Critical decisions involve core technology selections like @legendapp/state and 
  expo, prioritizing performance and compatibility. Implementation details can be 
  dynamically loaded, enabling flexible, context-aware development strategies.

  Contextual research embeddings represent an innovative approach to knowledge 
  integration. By directly injecting condensed research insights into command 
  structures, the system enables more intelligent, context-aware execution without 
  separate reference files.

  Preliminary token efficiency investigations suggest natural language provides more
   compressed information representation for language models compared to rigid 
  structured formats. This insight hints at potential optimization strategies for 
  knowledge transmission and processing. The core problem isn't format, but 
  inefficient research handling. Key issues include unnecessary information loading,
   treating all research as equally important, and lacking strategic information 
  organization.

  I see several promising strategies to address these challenges:
  - Load research dynamically based on specific task requirements
  - Use progressive information disclosure
  - Implement relevance-based research scoring
  - Pre-compute contextual research summaries
  - Embed relevant research directly into command templates

  These approaches prioritize targeted, efficient information retrieval, ensuring 
  only the most pertinent research supports each specific task.
