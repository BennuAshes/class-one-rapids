  ⎿  Allowed 6 tools for this command

✻ Thinking…

  This is a complex command to transform the refinement.md file to work with Product Requirements
   Documents (PRDs) instead of individual story files. Let me first read the current 
  refinement.md to understand its structure, then plan the transformation.

  I need to:
  1. Read the current refinement.md file
  2. Understand its current structure and workflow
  3. Transform it to handle PRDs while preserving core refinement capabilities
  4. Update the input/output patterns to work with PRD files and multiple features

  Let me start by reading the current refinement.md file.

● I'll transform the refinement.md command to intelligently process Product Requirements
  Documents while preserving its core refinement capabilities. Let me start by reading the
  current refinement.md structure.

● Read(.claude/commands/refinement.md)
  ⎿  Read 94 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand the current refinement.md structure. It's focused on refining individual story
   files through 4 phases:

  1. Story Context Analysis - reads story file and relevant research
  2. Story Analysis and Refinement Planning - decomposes and analyzes the story
  3. Story Refinement Execution - enhances the story with technical design details
  4. Story File Enhancement - uses Edit tool to update the story file

  Now I need to transform this to work with PRDs. The key changes will be:

  1. Input Change: From <story-file-path> <output-file-path> to <prd-file-path> 
  [output-directory]
  2. Processing Change: From single story to multiple features/stories extracted from PRD
  3. Output Change: From editing single story file to creating multiple refined feature files
  4. Analysis Change: From story-focused to PRD holistic analysis with feature extraction

  The transformation should:
  - Parse PRD structure to extract features/stories
  - Maintain the same quality of refinement for each extracted feature
  - Generate multiple output files in a directory structure
  - Preserve traceability back to PRD sections
  - Keep all the architectural expertise and design patterns

  Let me create a comprehensive transformation using MultiEdit to update the refinement.md file.

● Now I'll transform the refinement.md command to handle PRDs while preserving all its refinement
   capabilities. I'll use MultiEdit to make comprehensive changes.

✻ Thinking…

  Great! I've successfully transformed the refinement.md command to handle PRDs. Let me now also 
  create a TodoWrite task list to track what I've accomplished, since this was a significant 
  transformation task.

  The transformation has successfully:

  1. Updated the description and arguments to work with PRDs instead of individual stories
  2. Transformed Phase 1 from story context analysis to PRD context analysis, including 
  extraction of features from the PRD
  3. Updated Phase 2 to handle multiple features and cross-feature dependencies from PRD analysis
  4. Modified Phase 3 to focus on creating multiple refined feature files rather than editing a 
  single story
  5. Completely reworked Phase 4 to generate multiple feature files with proper directory 
  structure, index files, and traceability documentation

  The command now:
  - Takes a PRD file path and optional output directory
  - Extracts multiple features from the PRD
  - Creates individual refined feature files
  - Maintains traceability back to the PRD
  - Generates supporting documentation (index.md, prd-mapping.md)
  - Preserves all the architectural expertise and refinement quality

  Let me create a todo list to track this accomplishment and verify the transformation worked 
  correctly by reading the updated file.

● Update Todos

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! The transformation is complete and maintains all the quality elements. Let me complete
   the verification todo and provide a summary of what was accomplished.

  The transformed refinement.md command now:

  1. Handles PRD Input: Changed from <story-file-path> <output-file-path> to <prd-file-path> 
  [output-directory]
  2. Extracts Multiple Features: Phase 1 now includes extraction of features from PRD structure
  3. Processes Cross-Feature Dependencies: Phase 2 analyzes dependencies across multiple features
  4. Maintains Architectural Excellence: All the original refinement methodology, SOLID 
  principles, DDD patterns, etc. are preserved
  5. Generates Multiple Outputs: Phase 4 creates individual feature files plus index and mapping 
  files
  6. Preserves Traceability: Each feature file includes PRD reference sections
  7. Maintains INVEST and Vertical Slicing: All quality principles are preserved

  The command successfully transforms from single-story refinement to comprehensive PRD-based 
  feature extraction while maintaining all architectural expertise and quality standards.

● Update Todos

  while maintaining the same technical excellence and architectural soundness as the original
  story refinement process.

> did you create a new file? or did you modify the old one and then use the modified file to 
  compare against itself?

● I modified the existing file. I used the MultiEdit tool to transform the original
  /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/.claude/commands/refinement.md file in place, then used the Read
  tool to verify the changes were applied correctly.

  No new files were created - I followed the CLAUDE.md instruction to "ALWAYS prefer editing an
  existing file to creating a new one."

  The workflow was:
  1. Read the original refinement.md
  2. Use MultiEdit to apply 6 comprehensive edits to transform it
  3. Read the same file again to verify the transformation was successful

> can you save the original file as refinement-original.md

● Done. The original version of refinement.md has been saved as
  /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/.claude/commands/refinement-original.md using the git history.

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to create a command that:

  1. Takes in a PRD that has had technical details carefully lined out
  2. Uses research/planning/structure-task-decomposition-research.md 
  3. Creates a runbook an agent can follow (simple enough for a junior developer)
  4. Based on the PRD, following it exactly and exactly as the technical specifics lay out

  So this is a workflow/automation command that needs to:
  - Read and parse a technically detailed PRD
  - Use task decomposition research to structure the output
  - Generate a step-by-step runbook/guide
  - Make it simple enough for junior developers
  - Follow the PRD specifications exactly

  Let me first read the task decomposition research file to understand the methodology, then 
  create the command.

  This should be classified as a workflow automation command since it's converting high-level 
  technical requirements into actionable step-by-step instructions.

  Key aspects:
  - Input: Technically detailed PRD
  - Processing: Task decomposition methodology
  - Output: Junior-developer-friendly runbook
  - Quality: Must follow PRD exactly
  - Complexity: Multi-step workflow with structured output

● I'll create an advanced command that transforms technically detailed PRDs into step-by-step
  runbooks following task decomposition research. Let me first read the task decomposition
  research to understand the methodology.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have the structured task decomposition research. This gives me a comprehensive 
  understanding of how to break down complex tasks into manageable components. Key insights from 
  the research:

  1. Hierarchical Structure: Use systematic levels from strategic to tactical to operational
  2. Progressive Elaboration: Break down only what's needed immediately in detail
  3. Atomic Actionability: Tasks should be completable without further breakdown
  4. Cognitive Limitations: Respect Miller's 7±2 rule for human working memory
  5. Multi-perspective Validation: Technical, temporal, stakeholder, and risk perspectives
  6. Quality Criteria: Complete, Consistent, Correct, Comprehensible

  The command should:
  - Take a technically detailed PRD as input
  - Apply these task decomposition principles
  - Generate a step-by-step runbook that's simple enough for junior developers
  - Follow the PRD specifications exactly
  - Structure the output hierarchically with clear phases and actionable tasks

  Let me design and implement this command now.
