✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll apply vertical slicing analysis to the features. Using the INVEST criteria and the 
  principles I learned from the vertical slicing research:

  INVEST Criteria Analysis:
  - Independent: Each slice should be developable independently
  - Negotiable: Details can be discussed and refined
  - Valuable: Delivers tangible benefit to users
  - Estimable: Scope can be reasonably estimated
  - Small: Completable within a single iteration
  - Testable: Clear criteria for validation

  Vertical Slice Analysis for PetSoft Tycoon:

  1. Core Gameplay Loop (Epic 1) - This is a well-structured vertical slice that delivers 
  end-to-end value:
    - Independent: Can be developed without other features
    - Valuable: Establishes the core game mechanic
    - Small: Can be completed in 1-2 sprints
    - Testable: Clear progression milestones
  2. Department Systems (Epic 2) - Good vertical slice with clear boundaries:
    - Independent: Builds on core loop but adds new dimension
    - Valuable: Introduces strategic depth
    - Small: Each department can be a sub-slice
    - Testable: Clear revenue calculations and interactions
  3. Prestige System (Epic 3) - Complex but valuable vertical slice:
    - Independent: Requires core loop but provides distinct value
    - Valuable: Enables long-term progression
    - Small: May need to be broken into smaller slices
    - Testable: Clear reset and bonus mechanics
  4. Polish & UX (Epic 4) - These are cross-cutting concerns that need to be integrated into 
  other slices rather than standalone

  Recommended Slice Prioritization:
  1. Core Gameplay Loop (Foundation)
  2. First Department System (Sales)
  3. Department Synergies
  4. Basic Prestige System
  5. Advanced Prestige Features
  6. Additional Departments

  7. Enhanced Polish Features

  I'll focus on refining user experience and interface elements that elevate the game's overall 
  quality. These polish features will incrementally improve player engagement through subtle yet 
  impactful design enhancements. The goal is to create intuitive, delightful interactions that 
  make the game feel polished and professional.

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to execute the ULTRATHINK analysis. Based on the comprehensive knowledge I've 
  gathered, I need to deeply analyze the technical implications of the PRD features:

  Architecture Implications:
  - The PRD specifies a web-based idle game using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Web Audio
   API
  - However, based on my research, modern React Native/Expo with Legend State would provide 
  significant advantages
  - The game needs real-time state updates, persistent storage, offline progression, and 
  cross-platform deployment
  - Performance requirements (60fps, <50ms response) are achievable with both approaches but 
  React Native provides better optimization

  Implementation Complexity:
  - The game has complex state management requirements with multiple interconnected systems 
  (departments, upgrades, prestige)
  - Legend State would provide automatic persistence, fine-grained reactivity, and superior 
  performance
  - Cross-cutting concerns like audio, animations, and visual feedback need coordinated 
  implementation
  - Testing requirements include unit tests for calculations, integration tests for department 
  interactions, and E2E tests for user flows

  Technology Stack Alignment:
  - Current Vanilla JS approach is functional but lacks modern development benefits
  - React Native + Expo provides cross-platform deployment from single codebase
  - TypeScript would prevent calculation errors and improve team collaboration
  - Legend State handles complex state management with automatic persistence

  Scalability and Maintenance:
  - Vertical slicing approach would organize code by features rather than technical layers
  - Component-based architecture enables parallel development and easier maintenance  
  - Modern tooling provides better debugging, testing, and deployment capabilities

  Cross-Cutting Concerns:
  - State persistence is critical for idle games - Legend State provides built-in solutions
  - Performance monitoring and analytics need to be integrated from the start
  - Error handling and recovery mechanisms are essential for long-running sessions
  - Accessibility and internationalization should be considered for broader reach

  Now I'll proceed to Phase 4 to create the technical requirements integration.

  COMPREHENSIVE ARCHITECTURE VALIDATION

  1. VERTICAL SLICING COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

  ✅ PASSED CRITERIA:
  - ✅ Feature-Based Organization: Clear feature directories (core-gameplay/,
  department-systems/, prestige-system/, audio-visual/)
  - ✅ High Cohesion Within Slices: Each feature contains all related functionality (components,
  hooks, state, tests)
  - ✅ Physical Co-location: Related code grouped within feature directories
  - ✅ End-to-End Functionality: Each feature slice includes complete implementation from UI to
  state management
  - ✅ User Value Focus: Each feature directly maps to user stories and delivers tangible value

  ✅ NO FORBIDDEN PATTERNS DETECTED:
  - ✅ No Horizontal Layering: No separate src/entities/, src/utils/, src/services/ directories
  - ✅ Feature-Centric Organization: Code organized by business feature, not technical layer

  2. REACT NATIVE ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

  ✅ PASSED CRITERIA:
  - ✅ Feature-Based Structure: Components organized by feature domain
  (features/core-gameplay/components/)
  - ✅ Custom Hooks Implementation: State logic extracted to custom hooks (useGameLoop,
  useEmployeeHiring, useCameraTransition)
  - ✅ PascalCase Components: All React components use proper naming (WriteCodeButton,
  PrestigeDialog, OfficeLayout)
  - ✅ Mobile-Specific Patterns: Proper use of React Native APIs (Animated, Pressable, Platform)

  ❌ MINOR VIOLATIONS DETECTED:
  - ❌ Barrel Exports Present: Implementation shows src/shared/types/index.ts with re-exports
  - ❌ Shared Directory Structure: src/shared/ directory exists outside features (partial
  horizontal layering)

  3. LEGEND STATE ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

  ✅ PASSED CRITERIA:
  - ✅ Modular State Architecture: Clear separation of concerns (gameState$, computedValues$)
  - ✅ State Co-location: State management within features where used (features/*/state/)
  - ✅ Observable Composition: Computed values and reactive patterns properly implemented
  - ✅ Type Safety: Full TypeScript interfaces for game state
  - ✅ Performance Patterns: Proper use of fine-grained reactivity and automatic persistence

  ⚠️ POTENTIAL CONCERNS:
  - ⚠️ Centralized State Pattern: Single gameState$ observable may be too monolithic
  - ⚠️ Cross-Feature State Sharing: Some state patterns may create coupling between features

  4. TASK DECOMPOSITION COMPLIANCE VALIDATION

  ✅ PASSED CRITERIA:
  - ✅ Atomic Actionability: All tasks include complete implementation details with code examples
  - ✅ Cognitive Load Management: Clear 5-phase hierarchy respects 7±2 rule
  - ✅ Progressive Elaboration: Near-term work (Phases 1-2) fully detailed, later phases
  appropriately high-level
  - ✅ Implementation Content: No empty directory creation - all tasks produce working code
  - ✅ Clear Acceptance Criteria: Each task has specific success criteria and validation steps

> /create-command-advanced is running… create a command that takes in a report like 
/projects/pet-software-idler/architecture-validation-report.md created by the 
validate-architecture-alignment.md command and traces the flow in README.md to figure out what 
caused the issues in the report.
  ⎿  Allowed 13 tools for this command

✻ Thinking…

  Let me analyze this command request carefully:

  The user wants me to create a command that:
  1. Takes in a report like /projects/pet-software-idler/architecture-validation-report.md 
  2. This report was created by the validate-architecture-alignment.md command
  3. The new command should trace the flow in README.md to figure out what caused the issues in 
  the report

  So this is essentially a root cause analysis command that needs to:
  - Read an architecture validation report
  - Parse the issues/violations found in that report
  - Trace back through the workflow documented in README.md to understand how those issues 
  originated
  - Identify the specific steps or decisions that led to the architectural violations

  This is a complex analytical command that needs to:
  1. Parse structured reports (architecture validation reports)
  2. Understand workflow dependencies and causation
  3. Trace backwards through a documented process
  4. Identify root causes and decision points
  5. Provide actionable insights about process improvements

  Let me classify this:
  - Category: Analysis/Investigation
  - Complexity: High (multi-step workflow with complex reasoning)
  - Tools needed: File reading, text parsing, workflow analysis
  - Context needs: Project-aware, historical understanding
  - Performance priorities: Accuracy over speed (this is diagnostic work)

  This fits the debug_template pattern most closely, but with elements of workflow analysis. It's
   essentially a post-mortem analysis command.

  Key features needed:
  1. Report parsing capabilities
  2. Workflow tracing logic
  3. Root cause identification
  4. Process improvement recommendations
  5. Clear output formatting

  Let me design this with:
  - Root cause analysis methodology
  - Backward tracing through documented workflows
  - Pattern recognition for common failure modes
  - Actionable recommendations for process improvement

● Looking at this request, I need to create a sophisticated root cause analysis command that can
  trace architectural violations back through documented workflows. This is a complex analytical
  task requiring workflow understanding, issue pattern recognition, and causal reasoning.
