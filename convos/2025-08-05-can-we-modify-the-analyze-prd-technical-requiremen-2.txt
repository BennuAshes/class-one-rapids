> Can we modify the analyze-prd-technical-requirements.md to create a copy of the PRD rather than
   modifying the original?

● I'll help you modify the analyze-prd-technical-requirements.md command to create a copy of the
  PRD rather than modifying the original. Let me first examine the current command file.

● Read(.claude/commands/prp/analyze-prd-technical-requirements.md)
  ⎿  Read 212 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now I'll modify the command to create a copy of the PRD rather than modifying the original.
  I'll need to update the instructions to first copy the PRD file before adding the technical
  requirements.

● Done! The command now creates a copy of the PRD with a -technical-requirements suffix instead
  of modifying the original file. The key changes:

  1. Step 1 now creates a copy with -technical-requirements suffix
  2. Step 2 works with the copy while preserving original content
  3. Updated the deliverable description to reflect creating a new file
  4. Renumbered subsequent steps accordingly

  The original PRD file will remain unchanged, and all technical analysis will be added to the
  new copy.

       136 +      COMMAND_ARG="using $INPUT_ARG"
       137 +  else

> /create-command-advanced is running… create a command that creates a shell script based on a 
description
  ⎿  Allowed 13 tools for this command

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to create a command that creates shell scripts based on descriptions. Let
   me analyze this request using the advanced framework provided:

  Pattern Recognition

  - Command category: Automation/Code Generation
  - Complexity: Medium-high (generates shell scripts dynamically)
  - Tool requirements: File operations (Write), possibly Bash for testing
  - Context needs: Minimal to moderate (understand shell scripting patterns)
  - Performance priorities: Accuracy and reliability (generated scripts must work)

  Requirement Extraction

  - Primary objective: Generate functional shell scripts from natural language descriptions
  - Input: Description of what the script should do
  - Output: Complete, executable shell script
  - Constraints: Must generate syntactically correct bash/shell code
  - Error tolerance: High (scripts must work reliably)
  - Reusability: High (different types of scripts for different purposes)

  Template Selection

  This falls into the automation_template category since it's about automating the creation of 
  automation scripts. It's also somewhat of a code generation task.

  Advanced Features Needed

  - Shell script pattern recognition: Different types of scripts (system admin, development 
  workflow, data processing, etc.)
  - Best practices integration: Error handling, argument parsing, logging
  - Template library: Common script patterns and structures
  - Validation: Syntax checking of generated scripts
  - Security considerations: Safe script generation practices

  Key Considerations

  1. Script Categories: Need to recognize different types of scripts and apply appropriate 
  patterns
  2. Argument Handling: Generated scripts should have proper command-line interface
  3. Error Handling: Generated scripts should be robust
  4. Documentation: Scripts should be self-documenting
  5. Testing: Ability to validate generated scripts
  6. Security: Avoid generating potentially dangerous scripts

  Let me design a comprehensive command for this:

● I'll create an advanced command for generating shell scripts based on descriptions. This
  command will use intelligent pattern recognition and template-based generation.

● Write(.claude/commands/generate-shell-script.md)

✻ Thinking…

  I notice that the system is telling me that generate-full-workflow.sh was modified, but the 
  snippet shown seems odd - it shows "No newline at end of file" and then what looks like a 
  claude command. This doesn't match what I expect the file content to be. Let me ignore this for
   now since the user is already aware and focus on what they asked for.

  The user asked me to create a command that creates shell scripts based on descriptions, and 
  I've successfully created the /generate-shell-script command. Now let me test it to make sure 
  it works properly.

● Perfect! I've created an advanced /generate-shell-script command that uses intelligent pattern
  recognition and template-based generation. Let me test it to show you how it works:

● Bash(claude /generate-shell-script "Create a backup script that backs up a directory to a
      timestamped archive")
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> /model 
  ⎿  Set model to opus (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)

> any feedback on the generate-shell-script.md command?

● The /generate-shell-script.md command is well-structured and comprehensive! Here's my feedback:

  Strengths:

  1. Excellent Pattern Recognition - The intelligent analysis section effectively categorizes
  scripts by type (automation, workflow, sysadmin, etc.), which is crucial for template
  selection.
  2. Comprehensive Templates - The three core templates (AUTOMATION, WORKFLOW, SYSADMIN) cover
  most common use cases with proper error handling, logging, and best practices built-in.
  3. Security-First Approach - Good emphasis on privilege checking, input sanitization, and safe
  temporary file handling.
  4. User Experience - Colored output, progress indicators, and comprehensive help systems are
  excellent additions.

  Suggestions for Improvement:

  1. Add More Templates:
    - DATA_PROCESSING_TEMPLATE for scripts handling CSV/JSON/XML parsing
    - DEPLOYMENT_TEMPLATE for CI/CD and deployment automation
    - MONITORING_TEMPLATE for health checks and alerting
  2. Enhanced Pattern Recognition:
  <pattern_keywords>
    <automation>backup, copy, move, sync, archive</automation>
    <workflow>pipeline, process, step, stage, orchestrate</workflow>
    <sysadmin>install, configure, setup, service, daemon</sysadmin>
    <data>parse, extract, transform, convert, analyze</data>
  </pattern_keywords>
  3. Add Common Utility Functions Library:
  # Common utilities to include
  - retry_with_backoff()
  - confirm_action()
  - check_dependencies()
  - create_temp_workspace()
  - cleanup_on_exit()
  4. Template Variables Enhancement:
  Consider adding placeholders for:
    - [DEPENDENCY_CHECKS] - For required command validation
    - [CLEANUP_ACTIONS] - For trap-based cleanup
    - [CONFIG_LOADING] - For .env or config file support
  5. Add Interactive Mode Detection:
  # Detect if running interactively
  if [[ -t 0 ]]; then
      INTERACTIVE=true
  else
      INTERACTIVE=false
  fi
  6. Version and Update Mechanism:
  readonly SCRIPT_VERSION="1.0.0"
  readonly UPDATE_URL="https://..."

  Minor Enhancements:

  1. Argument Parsing - Consider adding getopt/getopts examples for complex argument handling
  2. Dry-Run Mode - Add a standard --dry-run flag pattern
  3. Verbosity Levels - Implement -v, -vv, -vvv for debugging
  4. Lock Files - Add patterns for preventing concurrent execution when needed

  Quick Fix for Template:

  The WORKFLOW_TEMPLATE has a placeholder [STEP_COUNT] that should be dynamically calculated.
  Consider adding:
  TOTAL_STEPS=$(grep -c "execute_step" "$0")

  Overall, this is a very strong command that will generate production-quality shell scripts! The
   intelligent analysis and template selection approach is particularly impressive.
