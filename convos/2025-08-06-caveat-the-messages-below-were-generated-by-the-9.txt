> How can we work around this? Can we save the runbook as a folder and each story as a file? 
  would that be separate requests and therefore work around this limit? if so how can we update 
  the command for this?

● You're absolutely right! We can work around the character limit by breaking the runbook into
  multiple files. This is actually a better approach for usability and maintainability.

  Let me suggest a structure and update approach:

  Proposed File Structure

  petsoft-tycoon-implementation-runbook/
  ├── README.md                           # Main runbook index
  ├── 01-executive-summary.md            # Project overview
  ├── 02-prerequisites-setup.md          # Environment setup
  ├── 03-phase1-foundation.md            # Foundation phase tasks
  ├── 04-phase2-core-features.md         # Core features phase
  ├── 05-phase3-integration.md           # Integration phase
  ├── 06-phase4-quality.md               # Quality assurance phase
  ├── 07-phase5-deployment.md            # Deployment phase
  ├── 08-validation-framework.md         # Quality validation
  └── 09-resources-support.md            # Resources and references

  Updated Command Approach

  We could modify the command to:

  1. Create the folder structure first
  2. Generate each section as a separate file
  3. Use multiple command invocations - each focusing on one phase/section

  Would you like me to:

  Option A: Complete the current runbook generation and save it as a single large file, then
  break it into sections in a follow-up step?

  Option B: Stop here and update the command to work with the multi-file approach, then re-run
  it?

  Option C: Continue with a condensed version that fits the limit, focusing on the most critical
  implementation details?

  Which approach would work best for your workflow? I can also suggest specific command
  modifications if you want to go with Option B.
