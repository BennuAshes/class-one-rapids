features too

● I'll help you generate a Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an Expo app
   foundation. Let me start by reading the PRD template and then creating a
  comprehensive requirements document.

     # Product Requirements Document: Expo App Foundation
     ## Introduction
     This document outlines the requirements for establishing a foundational
     Expo React Native application that serves as a scalable starting point for
      feature development. The app will provide essential infrastructure
     including navigation, state management, and development tooling while
     maintaining cross-platform compatibility for iOS, Android, and web
     platforms.
     ### Business Context
     Building a solid foundation for mobile application development accelerates
      time-to-market for new features while ensuring consistent user
     experiences across platforms. A well-structured Expo app foundation
     reduces technical debt, improves developer productivity, and provides a
     reliable base for iterative feature development.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read PRD template                   
     ☒ Generate PRD for Expo app foundation
     ☒ Save PRD document

● PRD created successfully at PRD-expo-app-foundation.md. The document defines
   5 core requirements for building a robust Expo app foundation:

  1. Cross-Platform Setup - TypeScript-enabled app running on iOS, Android,
  and web
  2. Navigation Infrastructure - Tab and stack navigation system
  3. State Management - Configured state solution with persistence
  4. Development Environment - Linting, formatting, and testing tools
  5. Component Library - Reusable UI components with theming support

  Each requirement includes clear acceptance criteria and the document
  specifies measurable success metrics focused on developer productivity and
  code quality.

● I'll generate a technical specification from the PRD for the Expo app
  foundation, focusing on actionable tasks that can be easily parsed and
  executed.

     # Technical Specification: Expo App Foundation
     ## Quick Summary
     Build a production-ready Expo React Native application foundation with
     TypeScript, navigation, state management, and development tooling that
     runs on iOS, Android, and web platforms.
     ## Implementation Tasks
     ### Requirement: Cross-Platform Application Setup
     **User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured Expo application with
     TypeScript support, so that I can build type-safe features across iOS,
     Android, and web platforms.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Read PRD-expo-app-foundation.md      
     ☒ Generate technical specification
     ☒ Save technical specification document

● Technical specification created at TECH-SPEC-expo-app-foundation.md. The
  spec breaks down the PRD into 30+ actionable tasks across 5 requirements,
  with clear checkboxes for tracking. Each requirement includes specific
  technical tasks, acceptance tests, and definition of done criteria. The
  development is organized into 3 phases over approximately 10 days.

> Do we have anything in memory?

● Let me check what's currently in the working directory and project structure
   to see what we have in memory from our session.

● Bash(pwd)
  ⎿  /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids

● List(/mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids)
  ⎿  Listed 134 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Yes, we have several things in memory from this session:

  1. PRD Documents Created:
    - PRD-expo-app-foundation.md - Product requirements for the Expo app
  foundation
    - PRD-asherons-call-idler-expo.md - Appears to be another PRD in the root
  2. Technical Specification:
    - TECH-SPEC-expo-app-foundation.md - Technical specification we just
  generated from the PRD
  3. Project Structure:
    - /project/ directory exists with some game design documents
    - Various research folders with architectural patterns and tech
  documentation
    - Role definitions in /roles/
    - Previous conversation exports in /convos/
  4. Key Configuration:
    - CLAUDE.md contains project-specific instructions (recently updated to
  use /project/ instead of /projects/[project-name]/)
    - Package.json exists, indicating Node.js project setup

  The main artifacts from our current session are the PRD and Technical
  Specification for building an Expo app foundation with TypeScript,
  navigation, state management (@legendapp/state), and development tooling.

> Do you have a knowledge graph?

● No, I don't have a knowledge graph currently implemented or active. However,
   I can see there's been research done on knowledge graphs in the codebase:

● Search(pattern: "**/*knowledge-graph*")
  ⎿  Found 4 files (ctrl+r to expand)

● There are 4 research documents about knowledge graphs in /research/:
  - knowledge-graphs-claude-code.md
  - knowledge-graph-extraction-strategies.md
  - knowledge-graph-implementation-recommendation.md
  - open-source-knowledge-graph-options.md

  These appear to be research into potentially implementing a knowledge graph
  system, but there's no active knowledge graph in use. The current project
  structure relies on:
  - Markdown documentation files
  - Role definitions
  - Research documents
  - Project-specific instructions in CLAUDE.md

  Would you like me to explore what the knowledge graph research contains or
  help implement one?
