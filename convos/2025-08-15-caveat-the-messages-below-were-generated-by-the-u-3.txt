     # Spec-Driven Development Process
     A structured approach to feature development using the Requirements-Design-Tasks
     (RDT) methodology.
     ## Overview
     The spec-driven process implements a formalized Product → Engineering → Development
     handoff workflow that ensures comprehensive feature documentation and clear
     traceability from business requirements to implementation.

> Make sure to encode into this process a human check each step. design, then 
  requirements, then tasks. does RDT typically start with requirements?

● You're right to question the order. Let me check the SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md
  again for the typical flow:

● Search(pattern:

● Based on the analysis, RDT typically flows: Requirements → Design → Tasks. However,
  you're suggesting Design → Requirements → Tasks with human checks at each step. This
  makes sense for a more iterative, validated approach. Let me create the process with
  this human-validated flow:

       14 -  ### Phase 1: Requirements First
       15 -  - **Document**: `requirements.md`
       16 -  - **Purpose**: Define what needs to be built and why from user/business 
          - perspective
       17 -  - **Human Check**: Product/stakeholder review for business alignment
       18 -  - **Gate**: Requirements approval before proceeding to design

       18 +  - **Gate**: Design approval before proceeding
       19    
       20 -  ### Phase 3: Tasks from Design
       20 +  ### Phase 2: Requirements from Design  
       21 +  - **Document**: `requirements.md`
       22 +  - **Purpose**: Translate technical design into user-facing requirements
       23 +  - **Human Check**: Product review for business alignment
       24 +  - **Gate**: Requirements approval before proceeding
       25 +  
       26 +  ### Phase 3: Tasks from Requirements
       27    - **Document**: `tasks.md`
       28 -  - **Purpose**: Break design into actionable work items
       29 -  - **Human Check**: Development team review for sprint planning
       30 -  - **Gate**: Task approval before implementation
       28 +  - **Purpose**: Break requirements into actionable work items

       34 -  - **Business Value**: Ensures solution addresses actual user needs
       35 -  - **Clear Goals**: Business objectives drive technical decisions
       36 -  - **Stakeholder Alignment**: Early agreement on feature scope
       37 -  - **Traceability**: All work traces back to business requirements
       34 +  - **Technical Feasibility**: Ensures proposed solution is architecturally 
     sound
          + sound
       35 +  - **Scope Clarity**: Technical constraints inform realistic requirements
       36 +  - **Resource Planning**: Implementation complexity drives accurate 
     estimates
       37 +  - **Risk Mitigation**: Technical challenges identified before commitments
       38    
       39    ## Human Validation Gates
       40    
       41    Each phase requires explicit human approval:
       42    
       43 -  1. **Requirements Gate**: Product owner/stakeholder sign-off
       44 -  2. **Design Gate**: Senior engineer/architect sign-off  
       43 +  1. **Design Gate**: Senior engineer/architect sign-off
       44 +  2. **Requirements Gate**: Product owner/stakeholder sign-off  
       45    3. **Tasks Gate**: Development team/scrum master sign-off
       46    
       47    ## Benefits
       48    
       49    - **Validated Progression**: Each step builds on approved foundation
       50 -  - **Clear Handoffs**: Product → Engineering → Development workflow
       51 -  - **Reduced Rework**: Early validation prevents late-stage changes
       52 -  - **Quality Assurance**: Human review catches issues automation misses
       53 -  
       54 -  ## Usage
       55 -  
       56 -  ```bash
       57 -  # Start new specification
       58 -  /spec new [feature-name]
       59 -  
       60 -  # Validate current phase
       61 -  /spec validate
       62 -  
       63 -  # Progress to next phase
       64 -  /spec next
       65 -  ```
       50   \ No newline at end of file
       51 +  - **Reduced Rework**: Early technical validation prevents late-stage 
     changes
       52 +  - **Clear Accountability**: Explicit approval points and ownership
       53 +  - **Quality Assurance**: Human review catches issues automation misses

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to think about how this spec-driven process would actually be 
  used. Let me consider the practical workflow:

  1. A user would use /spec new [feature-name] to start a new specification
  2. They would edit requirements.md with user stories
  3. They'd run /spec validate which would prompt for human review
  4. After approval, /spec next would move to design phase
  5. They'd edit design.md with technical architecture
  6. Another validation with human review
  7. Progress to tasks phase
  8. Edit tasks.md with implementation breakdown
  9. Final validation
  10. Complete specification ready for implementation

  But thinking about it in the context of this codebase and how Claude is being used... 
  this seems overly manual and process-heavy. The user would need to:
  - Manually edit files at each phase
  - Manually run validation commands
  - Have humans available to review at each gate

  This might not fit well with how they're actually working. They seem to be using 
  Claude to help generate and iterate on projects quickly. A heavy manual process with 
  multiple human gates might slow things down.

  Maybe they want something more automated where Claude helps generate each phase based 
  on the previous one, with lighter-weight validation?

● Looking at this process, I'm thinking it would be used like:

  1. User starts: /spec new user-auth
  2. Manual editing: User edits requirements.md with user stories
  3. Gate 1: /spec validate - prompts for human review approval
  4. Progress: /spec next moves to design phase
  5. Repeat: Edit design.md, validate, progress to tasks
  6. Final: Complete spec ready for implementation

  But honestly, this feels quite manual and heavyweight. Given how you're using Claude
  in this codebase, I'm wondering if you'd want something more like:

  - Claude helps generate each phase based on the previous one
  - Lighter validation (maybe just a checklist confirmation rather than full human
  review)
  - More integration with Claude's ability to analyze and generate specs

  Would you prefer a more automated approach where:
  1. User provides initial requirements/idea
  2. Claude generates draft requirements.md
  3. Quick human review/edit
  4. Claude generates design.md based on approved requirements
  5. Quick review
  6. Claude generates tasks.md from design
  7. Final approval

  That would leverage Claude's capabilities while still maintaining human checkpoints.
  What's your vision for how this would actually be used?

> Close: you create a requirements document from the description provided by the user. 
  Then a design document is created from the requirements. Then a task list is formed 
  from the requirements and design document. You generate each one at each step. They 
  can modify what you generate but they are not filling out the document initally like 
  you suggest

● Ah, got it! So the flow is:

  1. User describes feature → Claude generates requirements.md
  2. Human reviews/tweaks → /spec next
  3. Claude reads requirements → generates design.md
  4. Human reviews/tweaks → /spec next
  5. Claude reads requirements + design → generates tasks.md
  6. Human approves → Ready for implementation

  So the command needs to trigger Claude to generate each document based on the previous
   phase(s). Let me redesign this:

  - prompt.md: Template for Claude to generate each phase
  - templates/: Reference templates for requirements, design, and tasks
  - validation-checklist.md: Quality assurance checklist

  The process works as:
  1. User describes feature → Claude generates requirements
  2. User reviews/approves → Claude generates design from requirements
  3. User reviews/approves → Claude generates tasks from requirements + design
  4. Ready for implementation with full traceability

  - Includes best practices and thinking process guidance
  - Approach: Guided structure with flexibility

  create-command-advanced.md (Advanced - Intelligent)

  - 176 lines, most comprehensive
  - Pattern recognition to auto-select templates
  - Type-specific templates (workflow, debug, analysis, automation)
  - Multiple optimization strategies (tokens, performance, reliability)
  - Advanced features: memory management, composability, self-improvement
  - Approach: Intelligent template selection with deep optimization

  Key Differences:

  Complexity Progression:
  - Simple → Structured → Intelligent
  - Manual → Guided → Automated

  Template Strategy:
  - None → Single template → Multiple type-specific templates
  - No patterns → Fixed structure → Pattern recognition

  Optimization Focus:
  - None → Token efficiency → Multi-dimensional (speed/tokens/reliability)
  - Basic → Best practices → Advanced strategies

  Use Cases:
  - create-command: Quick, simple commands when you trust Claude's judgment
  - command-creator: Standard commands needing consistent structure
  - create-command-advanced: Complex workflows requiring optimization

  The evolution shows increasing sophistication in meta-programming, moving from pure
  reliance on Claude's capabilities to providing increasingly structured frameworks and
  intelligent pattern matching.

> Where is the /spec command? You say its mentioned in command.md but its just 
  describing a command I can't find anywhere. Its weird its in the .claude/commands/ 
  folder

● You're right - I created documentation for a /spec command but never created the
  actual executable command! The command.md file I created is just describing how it
  would work, but there's no actual command implementation.

  Looking at what I created:
  - .claude/commands/spec/README.md - Process overview
  - .claude/commands/spec/command.md - Usage documentation (but no actual command)
  - .claude/commands/spec/prompt.md - Template for Claude
  - .claude/commands/spec/templates/ - Reference templates
  - .claude/commands/spec/validation-checklist.md - Quality checklist

  I never created the actual command file that would make /spec work. In the
  .claude/commands/ folder, commands typically need either:
  1. A shell script (command.sh) that can be executed
  2. Or a markdown file with the actual prompt that Claude would execute

  The command.md file I created is just documentation, not an executable command. Would
  you like me to create the actual working /spec command that implements the RDT
  process?

> Yes, as a claude code command. There's some relevant research at /research/agentic/ - 
  think deeply and long about this information, and come up with a command. Then 
  ULTRATHINK and think longer and think deeper, and come up with a plan for creating the
   best version of that command, and then implement that plan.

✻ Thinking…

  Let me first explore the research at /research/agentic/ to understand the deeper 
  principles that should inform this command.

  I need to:
  1. Read and understand the agentic research
  2. Think deeply about how to create a powerful /spec command
  3. ULTRATHINK to refine and improve the approach
  4. Create a plan for the best version
  5. Implement that plan

  Let me start by exploring what's in the agentic research folder.

● List(research/agentic)
  ⎿  Listed 13 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  The files look legitimate - they're research documents about AI agent design, prompt 
  engineering, and optimization strategies. Let me read the key research files to 
  understand the principles deeply.

● Read(research/agentic/ai-agent-runbooks.md)
  ⎿  Read 397 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  This is incredibly comprehensive research on AI agent runbooks. Key insights:

  1. Multi-agent systems - Each agent specializes in specific functions
  2. Structured task models - Clear dependencies and data flow
  3. Governance and compliance - Built-in audit trails and human oversight
  4. Phased implementation - Start small, scale gradually
  5. Self-improvement mechanisms - Continuous optimization

  Let me continue reading the other research files to get a fuller picture.

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent insights here too:
  1. XML-structured prompts - Claude responds exceptionally well to XML structure
  2. Tree-based prompting - Explore multiple solution paths
  3. Self-correction techniques - Review and improve responses
  4. Iterative optimization - Continuous improvement
  5. Multi-agent orchestration - Running multiple agents in parallel
  6. Context engineering vs just prompt engineering

  Let me look at role-persona research as well.

✻ Thinking…

  Great insights on role design:
  1. Clear boundaries - What the agent should and shouldn't do
  2. Domain expertise - Role-specific knowledge and best practices
  3. Communication patterns - Appropriate tone and style for the role
  4. Decision-making framework - Problem-solving approaches
  5. SDLC roles - Different specialized roles for different phases

  Let me also look at the token optimization research for efficiency strategies.

● Now let me think deeply about creating the best /spec command...

  THINKING DEEPLY

  Based on the research, I need to create a /spec command that:

  1. Leverages AI Agent Runbook principles: Clear role definitions, structured task
  models, governance checkpoints
  2. Uses XML-structured prompts: Claude responds best to XML with clear role
  definitions
  3. Implements tiered memory: Progressive context loading (requirements → design →
  tasks)
  4. Optimizes tokens: Compact representation, smart context pruning
  5. Follows pattern templates: Use formal pattern structure (Name, Intent, Solution,
  Consequences)
  6. Enables multi-agent orchestration: Each phase could be a specialized agent
  7. Includes validation gates: Human checkpoints at each phase
  8. Maintains traceability: Clear links between requirements → design → tasks

  ULTRATHINKING - DEEPER ANALYSIS

  The /spec command should be more than just a document generator. It should be:

  1. A Workflow Orchestrator: Managing the entire specification lifecycle
  2. A Context Manager: Intelligently maintaining state across phases
  3. A Quality Guardian: Enforcing validation and completeness checks
  4. A Knowledge Builder: Learning from each specification to improve future ones
  5. A Collaboration Bridge: Facilitating human-AI partnership at key decision points

  Key Design Decisions:

  1. State Management: Use a .spec-state.json file to track:
    - Current phase
    - Validation status
    - Human feedback history
    - Generation parameters
  2. Progressive Enhancement: Each phase builds on the previous:
    - Requirements define the "what"
    - Design translates to "how"
    - Tasks break down to "when"
  3. Validation Framework: Each phase has:
    - Auto-validation checks
    - Human review prompts
    - Quality metrics
    - Approval gates
  4. Token Optimization:
    - Use XML tags for structure (Claude-optimized)
    - Compress previous phases into summaries when generating next
    - Focus on essential information at each stage
  5. Error Recovery:
    - Save drafts at each stage
    - Allow rollback to previous phases
    - Provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

  PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTATION

  1. Create the main command file (spec.md) with:
    - Role definition as "Specification Architect"
    - XML-structured workflow
    - Phase-aware generation logic
    - Validation checkpoints
  2. Implement state management:
    - Track current phase and status
    - Store validation history
    - Maintain context between invocations
  3. Design phase-specific generators:
    - Requirements generator from user description
    - Design generator from requirements
    - Tasks generator from requirements + design
  4. Add validation logic:
    - Automated checks for completeness
    - Human review prompts
    - Approval workflow
  5. Include token optimization:
    - Smart summarization
    - Context pruning
    - Efficient formatting

  Let me now implement this plan:

● Created a comprehensive /spec command that:

  1. Implements RDT methodology with Requirements → Design → Tasks flow
  2. Uses XML structure optimized for Claude's processing
  3. Includes human validation gates at each phase
  4. Maintains state across invocations via .spec-state.json
  5. Provides clear traceability linking requirements to design to tasks
  6. Optimizes tokens through structured generation and smart context loading
  7. Handles errors gracefully with clear recovery paths

  The command supports actions:
  - /spec new [name] [description] - Start new specification
  - /spec generate - Generate next phase
  - /spec status - Check current status
  - /spec validate - Run validation checks
  - /spec approve - Approve and progress

  Each phase has specialized generation logic, validation criteria, and human review
  checkpoints, implementing the best practices from the AI agent runbook research.
