 What's new:
  • Upgraded Opus to version 4.1

> Look at the workflow listed in README.md in the root of class-one-rapids. Look at the commands 
  mentioned in the readme. For each of these items, ULTRATHINK think deeper and think harder 
  about the contents of the commands and answer these questions strictly in the context of 
  understanding where in the flow these items occurred. This includes tracing research mentioned.
   After going through each item, create a report of them all and create a file in the analysis 
  folder:
  1) Why are there empty folders for features that don't exist
  2) The entire game state is in one object. It may be easier to manage if it was broken up by 
  feature (maybe with "core" being a feature the others rely on? This may require more research 
  and thinking deeply on your part.
  3) There's helper functions instead of hooks
  4) entities folder shouldn't exist. entities should be apart of the feature as per 
  vertical-slicing guidelines (research/planning/vertical-slicing.md)
  5) What are widgets (src/widgets)? Are these components? Why are we calling them widgets? Are 
  they shared? If not, we should be putting them with the feature associated with them as per 
  vertical-slicing guidelines (research/planning/vertical-slicing.md)
  6) Are index.ts files standard for react or react-native? If not, where is this coming from?
  7) Why are some folders camelCase and some PascalCase? What commands or research files are 
  influencing this inconsistency?

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to analyze the workflow in the README.md and understand various aspects 
  of the codebase architecture and decisions. They want me to create a report analyzing several 
  specific questions about the codebase structure. Let me break this down:

  1. First, I need to read the README.md to understand the workflow and commands
  2. Then I need to analyze the commands mentioned in the readme
  3. I need to trace through the research and understand the context
  4. Finally, I need to create a comprehensive report in the analysis folder

  The user is asking me to "ULTRATHINK" and think deeper about the contents and trace where in 
  the flow these decisions occurred.

  Let me start by reading the README.md file to understand the workflow.

● I'll analyze the workflow and architecture decisions in the codebase. Let me start by examining

     # Architectural Inconsistency Analysis: PetSoft Tycoon Implementation
     **Date:** August 5, 2025
     **Analysis Type:** Deep Architectural Consistency Review
     **Project:** PetSoft Tycoon (Pet Software Idler Game)
     ---
     ## Executive Summary
     This analysis examines the architectural decisions made during the PetSoft Tycoon
     implementation against the established research principles and command-driven workflow. The
     analysis reveals **7 critical architectural inconsistencies** that diverge from
     vertical-slicing principles, Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) guidelines, and established best
     practices documented in the research files.

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! I have completed the comprehensive analysis and created a detailed report. Let me 
  provide a brief summary to the user of what I found.

● I've completed the comprehensive architectural inconsistency analysis and created a detailed
  report at /analysis/architectural-inconsistency-analysis-2025-08-05.md.

  Key Findings Summary:

  Critical Discovery: The implementation deviated significantly from the research-driven
  workflow, reverting to traditional layered architecture instead of following the
  vertical-slicing methodology that was established in the research files.

  The 7 Architectural Inconsistencies:

  1. Empty Feature Folders - Created during task decomposition but never implemented due to
  incomplete "atomic actionability" testing
  2. Monolithic Game State - Violates vertical slicing principles of high cohesion within
  features and low coupling between them
  3. Helper Functions vs Hooks - Used plain utility functions instead of React Native custom
  hooks pattern from research
  4. Entities Folder - Directly violates vertical slicing guidelines that entities should be
  co-located with features
  5. "Widgets" Terminology - Non-standard React Native nomenclature; should be "components"
  6. Index.ts Files - Web development pattern not standard in React Native ecosystem
  7. Inconsistent Naming - Mixed camelCase/PascalCase without established coding standards

  Root Cause Analysis:

  The workflow commands successfully incorporated research through phases 1-3, but Phase 4 
  implementation (/follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer) ignored the established research
  principles and reverted to familiar layered architecture patterns.

  The analysis traces each decision back to specific research files and command contexts, showing
   exactly where the implementation diverged from the vertical-slicing methodology established in
   research/planning/vertical-slicing.md and other research documents.

  This demonstrates the critical importance of maintaining research adherence throughout the
  entire implementation phase, not just during planning.

> Can you show me just the action items from the research

● Based on the architectural inconsistency analysis, here are the specific action items to align
  the implementation with the research:

  Immediate Actions:

  1. Refactor to Vertical Slices

  - Move src/entities/Department/ → src/features/departmentManagement/entities/
  - Move src/entities/Achievement/ → src/features/prestigeSystem/entities/
  - Move src/entities/Resource/ → src/features/gameCore/entities/
  - Move src/entities/Unit/ → src/features/departmentManagement/entities/

  2. Implement Missing Features

  - Complete src/features/hireDeveloper/ with actual implementation
  - Complete src/features/shipFeature/ with actual implementation
  - Complete src/features/triggerPrestige/ with actual implementation

  3. Replace Helper Functions with Custom Hooks

  // Convert src/shared/lib/numberUtils.ts functions to:
  const useGameEconomy = () => {
    const canAfford = useCallback((cost: number) => {...}, []);
    const formatCurrency = useCallback((amount: number) => {...}, []);
    return { canAfford, formatCurrency };
  };

  4. Break Up Monolithic Game State

  // Replace single gameState$ with feature-specific state:
  export const writeCodeState$ = observable({...});
  export const departmentState$ = observable({...});
  export const prestigeState$ = observable({...});
  export const gameState$ = observable({
    writeCode: writeCodeState$,
    departments: departmentState$,
    prestige: prestigeState$
  });

  5. Rename Widgets to Components

  - src/widgets/ → src/shared/components/ or move to respective features
  - src/widgets/ResourceDisplay/ → src/features/gameCore/components/ResourceDisplay/
  - src/widgets/DepartmentPanel/ → src/features/departmentManagement/components/DepartmentPanel/

  6. Remove Index Files

  - Delete all index.ts files
  - Update imports to use direct component paths
  - Follow React Native direct import patterns

  7. Standardize Naming Convention

  - Establish PascalCase for all component folders and files
  - Rename src/features/writeCode/ → src/features/WriteCode/
  - Rename src/features/hireDeveloper/ → src/features/HireDeveloper/

  Process Improvements:

  8. Add Architectural Enforcement

  - Add ESLint rules for naming conventions
  - Create import path linting rules
  - Add pre-commit hooks for architecture validation

  9. Create Architecture Documentation

  - Document Feature-Sliced Design guidelines for the team
  - Create vertical slicing implementation examples
  - Establish coding standards document

  10. Implement Review Gates

  - Add architecture review step before implementation
  - Ensure research principles are verified during code review
  - Create checklist for vertical slicing compliance

  These actions will align the codebase with the vertical-slicing methodology and React Native
  best practices established in the research files.

> my goal isn't to fix the app, its to figure out how to change the flow to avoid this happening 
  if I run the flow again. I want to be able to generate an POC from scratch just how I want, 
  every time

● Ah, I understand! You want to modify the workflow commands themselves to prevent these
  architectural inconsistencies from happening again when you run the flow from scratch.

  Command Flow Modifications Needed:

  1. Enhance /follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer Command

  Problem: Phase 4 implementation ignored research principles

  Solution: Add explicit research validation checkpoints:
  # Add to follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer.md

  ## MANDATORY RESEARCH VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS

  Before any implementation:
  1. **Architecture Compliance Check**: Verify directory structure follows
  research/planning/vertical-slicing.md patterns
  2. **React Native Standards Check**: Ensure patterns match research/tech/react-native.md
  conventions
  3. **State Management Check**: Confirm Legend State implementation follows
  research/tech/legend-state.md modular patterns

  ## IMPLEMENTATION BLOCKERS
  - STOP if creating `src/entities/` folder (violates vertical slicing)
  - STOP if using utility functions instead of custom hooks (violates React Native patterns)
  - STOP if creating monolithic state (violates Legend State research)
  - STOP if inconsistent naming conventions detected

  2. Modify /create-development-runbook Command

  Problem: Task decomposition created empty folders without atomic implementation

  Solution: Add validation criteria:
  # Add validation step referencing structured-task-decomposition-research.md

  ## TASK ATOMICITY VALIDATION
  Before creating any folder structure:
  - Apply "atomic actionability test" from
  research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md:132
  - Each folder MUST contain implementation, not just structure
  - No empty directories allowed in final structure

  3. Add New Command: /validate-architecture-alignment

  Purpose: Run between runbook creation and implementation

  # New command to add to .claude/commands/

  ## Usage
  /validate-architecture-alignment path/to/runbook.md

  ## Function
  - Parse planned directory structure from runbook
  - Cross-reference against research/planning/vertical-slicing.md
  - Block implementation if violations detected
  - Suggest corrections based on research files

  4. Enhance /analyze-prd-technical-requirements Command

  Problem: Technical analysis didn't enforce implementation patterns strongly enough

  Solution: Add specific implementation constraints:
  # Add to analyze-prd-technical-requirements.md

  ## MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS
  Based on research synthesis, implementations MUST:
  - Use feature-based folder structure (research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84)
  - Implement custom hooks over utilities (research/tech/react-native.md:1589-1614)
  - Use modular Legend State patterns (research/tech/legend-state.md:388-417)
  - Follow React Native component organization (research/tech/react-native.md:1656-1673)

  Any deviation from these patterns should HALT implementation.

  5. Add Research Enforcement to Command Chain

  Create a validation gate between commands 3 and 4:

  # Modified README.md workflow:
  - /generate-advanced-prd description of app/feature
  - /analyze-prd-technical-requirements path/to/prd.md
  - /create-development-runbook path/to/prd.md
  - /validate-architecture-alignment path/to/runbook.md  # NEW GATE
  - /follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer path/to/runbook.md

  6. Create Research-Specific Implementation Prompts

  Add to senior engineer command:
  ## RESEARCH-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS

  Before each implementation decision, ask:
  1. "Does this follow vertical-slicing principles from research/planning/vertical-slicing.md?"
  2. "Is this pattern documented in research/tech/react-native.md?"
  3. "Does this state management align with research/tech/legend-state.md?"
  4. "Would this structure pass the research validation checkpoints?"

  If ANY answer is "no" or "uncertain", STOP and redesign approach.

  7. Add Specific Anti-Patterns List

  Create explicit blockers in the senior engineer command:
  ## FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (Based on Research Analysis)
  - ❌ src/entities/ folder (violates vertical slicing)
  - ❌ src/widgets/ terminology (non-standard React Native)
  - ❌ index.ts re-export files (web pattern, not RN)
  - ❌ Utility function helpers (use custom hooks instead)
  - ❌ Monolithic state objects (use modular Legend State)
  - ❌ Mixed camelCase/PascalCase (establish consistency)
  - ❌ Empty feature folders (violates atomic actionability)

  The Root Solution:

  Make the commands self-enforcing by building research validation directly into the command
  logic, rather than relying on the implementer to remember and apply research principles.

  This way, every time you run the flow, it will automatically prevent architectural drift and
  ensure research-driven implementation.

> for #1, add  ## MANDATORY RESEARCH VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS but do not add the implementation 
  blockers. for #2, the runbook command shouldn't be creating any app folders or files, ONLY the 
  markdown file related to the runbook being created. #3 - use the create-command-advanced.md to 
  create the command you suggest. #4 - update this as suggested, #5 - update as suggested, #6 - 
  add this as suggested, #7 - lets just ignore this # for now and hope 1-6 take care of it

       206    **DELIVERABLE**: Enhanced PRD with comprehensive technical requirements section 
             that:
       207    - Preserves all original PRD content without modification
       208    - Adds detailed technical analysis based on ULTRATHINK processing
       209    - Provides actionable technical guidance for development teams
       210    - Maintains traceability from business requirements to technical implementation
       211 -  - Leverages full spectrum of available technical knowledge and best practices

● Now let me add the research-driven implementation prompts to the senior engineer command:

● Read(.claude/commands/follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer.md)
  ⎿  Read 100 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Update(.claude/commands/follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer.md)
  ⎿  Updated .claude/commands/follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer.md with 10 additions           
       35    - **Atomic Actionability**: Ensure each task is completable within appropriate time 
            boundaries
       36    - **Context-Dependent Adaptation**: Adjust granularity based on complexity and team 
            expertise level
       37    
       38 +  ## RESEARCH-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS
       39 +  
       40 +  Before each implementation decision, ask:
       41 +  1. "Does this follow vertical-slicing principles from 
          + research/planning/vertical-slicing.md?"
       42 +  2. "Is this pattern documented in research/tech/react-native.md?"
       43 +  3. "Does this state management align with research/tech/legend-state.md?"
       44 +  4. "Would this structure pass the research validation checkpoints?"
       45 +  
       46 +  If ANY answer is "no" or "uncertain", STOP and redesign approach.
       47 +  
       48    ## Usage
       49    
       50    ```bash

● Perfect! I've successfully implemented all the requested command flow modifications:

  Summary of Changes Made:

  ✅ #1 - Enhanced /follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer

  - Added MANDATORY RESEARCH VALIDATION CHECKPOINTS section
  - Did NOT add implementation blockers (as requested)

  ✅ #2 - Modified /create-development-runbook

  - Added TASK ATOMICITY VALIDATION section
  - Clarified that runbook command creates ONLY markdown files, not app folders
  - Emphasized atomic actionability testing before task creation

  ✅ #3 - Created /validate-architecture-alignment command

  - Used the command creation framework
  - Comprehensive validation against all research principles
  - Clear PASS/FAIL gate with blocking capability
  - Specific remediation guidance for violations

  ✅ #4 - Updated /analyze-prd-technical-requirements

  - Added MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS section
  - Explicit research principle enforcement
  - Clear directive to HALT implementation on deviations

  ✅ #5 - Updated README.md workflow

  - Added /validate-architecture-alignment as step 4
  - Creates validation gate between runbook creation and implementation

  ✅ #6 - Added research-driven implementation prompts

  - RESEARCH-DRIVEN IMPLEMENTATION PROMPTS section in senior engineer command
  - Four critical validation questions before each decision
  - STOP directive if any answer is uncertain

  The New Flow Will Now:

  1. Generate PRD with vertical slicing awareness
  2. Analyze technical requirements with mandatory constraints
  3. Create runbook with atomic actionability validation
  4. 🚫 VALIDATION GATE - Block if architecture violates research
  5. Implement with continuous research validation prompts

  This should prevent the architectural inconsistencies from happening again by making research
  adherence mandatory and enforced at multiple checkpoints throughout the workflow.
