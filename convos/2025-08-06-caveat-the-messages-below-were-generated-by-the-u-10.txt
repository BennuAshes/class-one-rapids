  ⎿ API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum. To configure this

> How can we work around this? Can we save the runbook as a folder and each story as a file? 
  would that be separate requests and therefore work around this limit? if so how can we update 
  the command for this?

● You're absolutely right! We can work around the character limit by breaking the runbook into
  multiple files. This is actually a better approach for usability and maintainability.

  Let me suggest a structure and update approach:

  Proposed File Structure

  petsoft-tycoon-implementation-runbook/
  ├── README.md                           # Main runbook index
  ├── 01-executive-summary.md            # Project overview
  ├── 02-prerequisites-setup.md          # Environment setup
  ├── 03-phase1-foundation.md            # Foundation phase tasks
  ├── 04-phase2-core-features.md         # Core features phase
  ├── 05-phase3-integration.md           # Integration phase
  ├── 06-phase4-quality.md               # Quality assurance phase
  ├── 07-phase5-deployment.md            # Deployment phase
  ├── 08-validation-framework.md         # Quality validation
  └── 09-resources-support.md            # Resources and references

  Updated Command Approach

  We could modify the command to:

  1. Create the folder structure first
  2. Generate each section as a separate file
  3. Use multiple command invocations - each focusing on one phase/section

  Would you like me to:

  Option A: Complete the current runbook generation and save it as a single large file, then
  break it into sections in a follow-up step?

  Option B: Stop here and update the command to work with the multi-file approach, then re-run
  it?

  Option C: Continue with a condensed version that fits the limit, focusing on the most critical
  implementation details?

  Which approach would work best for your workflow? I can also suggest specific command
  modifications if you want to go with Option B.

> How do I make sure my output token limit is configured as high as it can be?

● The output token limit is controlled by Claude's system settings, not user-configurable
  settings. Here are the approaches to work with token limits:

  Understanding the Limit

  - Claude has a maximum response length that varies by model and context
  - The limit applies per individual response, not per conversation
  - It's designed to ensure quality and prevent extremely long outputs

  Working Within Limits

  Best Approaches:

  1. Break into multiple requests - Ask for sections individually:
  "Generate just the Foundation Phase section of the runbook"
  "Now generate the Core Features Phase section"
  2. Use the file-per-section approach I suggested:
    - Each phase becomes a separate file
    - More manageable and navigable
    - Better for version control
  3. Request structured outlines first, then expand:
  "Create a detailed outline of the runbook"
  "Now expand section 3 with full implementation details"

  For Your Current Runbook

  Since we hit the limit, I recommend:

  Option 1: Continue with multi-file approach
  - I'll generate the README.md with the complete structure
  - Then we can tackle each phase file individually

  Option 2: Complete in chunks
  - Generate the runbook in 3-4 separate responses
  - Combine them manually afterward

  Would you like me to proceed with Option 1 (multi-file structure starting with the README.md)?
  This gives you the most usable result and works around the token limit naturally.

> "API Error: Claude's response exceeded the 32000 output token maximum. To configure this
      behavior, set the CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS environment variable."

● Perfect! You can increase the output token limit by setting the environment variable:

  Setting the Environment Variable

  For current session:
  export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=100000

  For permanent setting (add to your shell profile):
  # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
  echo "export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=100000" >> ~/.bashrc
  source ~/.bashrc

  For Windows (if using WSL):
  # In WSL terminal
  export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=100000

  # Or add to ~/.bashrc for persistence
  echo "export CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=100000" >> ~/.bashrc

  Recommended Values

  - Default: 32,000 tokens
  - High: 100,000 tokens (for large documents)
  - Maximum: Depends on your Claude plan, but 100K should work

  Apply the Change

  After setting the variable, restart your Claude Code session or source your profile:
  source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc

  Then re-run the command. The runbook generation should complete without hitting the token
  limit.

  Would you like me to wait while you set this up, or should I proceed with the multi-file
  approach as a backup plan?
