 What's new:
  • SDK: Add request cancellation support
  • SDK: New additionalDirectories option to search custom paths, improved slash command processing
  • Settings: Validation prevents invalid fields in .claude/settings.json files
  • MCP: Improve tool name consistency
  • Bash: Fix crash when Claude tries to automatically read large files

> is there a way for the spec.md command to know which project we're dealing with?

● I'll check the spec.md command to see how it determines which project to work with.

● Read(.claude/commands/spec.md)
  ⎿  Error reading file

● Search(pattern: "**/*spec*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Search(pattern: ".claude/commands/*")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

● Let me check if there's a spec command without the .md extension:

● List(.claude/commands)
  ⎿  Listed 29 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

● Now let me check the spec.md file:

● Read(.claude/commands/spec/spec.md)
  ⎿  Read 359 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Looking at the spec.md command, I can see it creates specifications in /projects/specs/[feature-name]/
  directory (line 45) and maintains state in a .spec-state.json file (line 292).

  The command determines which project/feature it's working with through:

  1. Command arguments - The feature name is passed as an argument when calling the command (lines 33-39)
  2. Directory structure - It creates a dedicated directory /projects/specs/[feature-name]/ for each
  specification
  3. State file - It tracks the current specification in .spec-state.json within that feature's directory

  So to answer your question: Yes, the spec.md command knows which project it's dealing with based on the 
  feature name argument provided when invoking it. For example:
  - /spec new authentication "User authentication system" would create specs for an "authentication" feature
  - /spec status would check the current active specification's state

  The command doesn't automatically detect which project you're currently working on from context - you need
   to explicitly provide the feature/project name when starting a new specification.

> Lets update the "new" to take in a project. And instead of storing /specs or .spec-state.json in /projects
   its /projects/[theirprojectname]

● I'll update the spec.md command to take a project parameter and store the specs within the project
  directory structure.

     ☒ Update all phase workflows to use new directory structure
     ☒ Test the updated command flow

● Done! The spec.md command has been updated to:

  1. Accept project parameter - Now requires project name for all actions
  2. New directory structure - Specs are stored in /projects/[project-name]/specs/[feature-name]/ instead of
   /projects/specs/
  3. State file in project - The .spec-state.json file is stored within the project's spec directory
  4. Updated command syntax:
    - new [project] [feature] [description]
    - generate [project] [feature]
    - status [project] [feature]
    - validate [project] [feature]
    - approve [project] [feature]

  The command will now create the project directory if it doesn't exist and organize all specifications
  within their respective project folders.

> /spec:spec is running… new pet-software-idler
  ⎿  Allowed 8 tools for this command

● I need to parse the arguments correctly for the new command format. The command expects: new [project] 
  [feature] [description], but only received "new pet-software-idler".

  Let me help you get started with creating a specification for the pet-software-idler project. You need to
  provide:
  1. The project name (pet-software-idler)
  2. The feature name
  3. A description

  For example:
  /spec new pet-software-idler core-gameplay "Core idle game mechanics including clicking, automation, and
  resource generation"

  Or if you want to create a specification for the entire project:
  /spec new pet-software-idler mvp "Minimum viable product for Pet Software Tycoon idle game"

  What feature would you like to create a specification for in the pet-software-idler project?

> base project with expo using legend-state @beta and expo's default routing

● I'll create a specification for the base project setup with Expo, Legend-State, and Expo Router.

     # Requirements Document
     ## Introduction
     Establish a modern React Native development foundation for Pet Software Tycoon idle game using Expo SDK,
      Legend-State for reactive state management, and Expo Router for file-based navigation. This base setup
     will provide a scalable, performant architecture that supports rapid feature development while
     maintaining code quality and developer experience.
     ## Requirements
     ### Requirement 1.1: Expo Development Environment
     **User Story:** As a developer, I want a fully configured Expo development environment, so that I can
     build and test the application across multiple platforms efficiently.
     … +67 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● ✅ Requirements Document Generated

  I've created the requirements specification for your base project setup with:
  - Expo SDK for cross-platform development
  - Legend-State @beta for reactive state management
  - Expo Router for file-based navigation
  - TypeScript configuration
  - Development tooling (ESLint, Prettier, Jest)
  - Performance baselines for responsive gameplay

  The specification is now in draft status in the requirements phase.

  Next Steps:

  1. Review the requirements at /projects/pet-software-idler/specs/base-setup/requirements.md
  2. Validate the requirements: /spec validate pet-software-idler base-setup
  3. Approve when ready: /spec approve pet-software-idler base-setup
  4. Generate design: /spec generate pet-software-idler base-setup (after approval)

  The requirements focus on establishing a solid technical foundation without getting into game-specific
  features, ensuring you have a performant, maintainable base for building the idle game mechanics.

● Now let me also update the instruction at the end to clarify the auto-generation behavior:

● Update(.claude/commands/spec/spec.md)
  ⎿  Updated .claude/commands/spec/spec.md with 1 addition and 1 removal

       371   \ No newline at end of file
       372 +  Execute the specification workflow based on the provided action and parameters. Maintain state 
           + across invocations and ensure proper phase progression with human validation at each step. When 
           + a phase is approved, automatically generate the next phase document to streamline the workflow.
       373   \ No newline at end of file

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☒ Update approve action to auto-generate next phase document
     ☒ Add conditional logic to check which phase was approved
     ☒ Test the auto-generation flow

● ✅ Command Updated

  The spec.md command has been updated to automatically generate the next phase document when you approve a
  phase.

  New workflow:

  1. Approve requirements → Automatically generates design document
  2. Approve design → Automatically generates tasks document
  3. Approve tasks → Marks specification as complete

  This eliminates the need to manually run /spec generate after each approval, streamlining the
  specification workflow.

  The approve action now:
  - Accepts both validated and draft phases (direct approval)
  - Auto-progresses to the next phase
  - Generates the next document automatically
  - Displays the generated content immediately

  Would you like me to generate the design document for your base-setup specification now that requirements
  are approved?

     # Design Document
     ## Overview
     This technical design establishes a TypeScript-first React Native architecture using Expo SDK 51+,
     Legend-State @beta for fine-grained reactive state management, and Expo Router v3 for type-safe
     file-based navigation. The architecture prioritizes performance through minimal re-renders, developer
     experience through strong typing and hot reload, and maintainability through clear separation of
     concerns.

● Done! I've updated the product.md file to reflect PetSoft Tycoon based on your design-doc.md. The key
  changes include:

  1. Game concept: Changed from Asheron's Call Idler to PetSoft Tycoon - a software company idle game
  2. Core mechanics: Building a tech company through department management instead of RPG character
  progression
  3. Victory condition: Reaching $1B valuation for IPO instead of character builds
  4. Systems: 7 departments (Dev, Sales, CX, Product, Design, QA, Marketing) instead of combat/magic systems
  5. Progression: Company growth from garage to tech giant instead of character leveling
  6. Meta-progression: Investor Rounds prestige system instead of Heritage system

  The product.md now accurately reflects your PetSoft Tycoon idle game design.

● ✅ Requirements Regenerated for PetSoft Tycoon

  I've recreated the base-setup requirements with the correct context from your knowledge files:

  Key Changes:

  - Game Context: PetSoft Tycoon (software company idle game) instead of generic setup
  - First Click Response: Focus on the "WRITE CODE" button and <50ms response time
  - Legend-State v3: Correctly using syncObservable with MMKV plugin (not the old v2 API)
  - Vertical Slicing: Following your development methodology with feature-based organization
  - Game Loop: 100ms update intervals for department production
  - Visual Feedback: Number popups, particles, and 60fps animations

  Technical Stack Aligned:

  - Expo with tabs template (includes Expo Router)
  - Legend-State v3 @beta with MMKV persistence
  - TypeScript with strict typing
  - Vertical feature structure (not horizontal layers)

  The requirements now properly reflect:
  1. PetSoft Tycoon's core gameplay (departments, resources, progression)
  2. Correct Legend-State v3 patterns from tech.md
  3. Vertical slicing from development-methodology.md
  4. Project structure from structure.md

       155 -  - Use `$.set()` for updates
       156 -  - Use `observer()` HOC or `useSelector()` hook for React components
       157 -  - Leverage computed observables for derived state
       154 +  - Use `gameState$.resources.money.set()` for mutations
       155 +  - Use `gameState$.resources.money.get()` for reading
       156 +  - Components use `observer()` HOC or `useSelector()` for reactivity
       157 +  - MMKV handles persistence automatically on state changes

       492    ## Error Handling
       493    
       494 -  - **State Corruption**: Legend-State persistence includes retry logic and fallback to default 
     state
           - state
       495 -  - **Navigation Errors**: Expo Router provides error boundaries for navigation failures
       496 -  - **TypeScript Errors**: Build-time type checking prevents runtime type errors
       497 -  - **Network Failures**: Implement exponential backoff for failed persistence syncs
       498 -  - **Memory Leaks**: Use Legend-State's automatic cleanup for subscriptions
       494 +  - **State Corruption**: MMKV persistence includes validation and fallback to defaults
       495 +  - **Rapid Clicks**: Input queue prevents click drops, all inputs processed
       496 +  - **Performance Degradation**: Game loop throttles automatically under load
       497 +  - **Offline Progress**: Capped at 12 hours to prevent overflow
       498 +  - **Animation Overlap**: Object pooling prevents memory leaks from animations
       499    
       500    ## Testing Strategy
       501    
       502 -  - **Unit Testing**: Jest with React Native Testing Library for components
       503 -  - **State Testing**: Test Legend-State mutations and computed values
       504 -  - **Navigation Testing**: Test Expo Router navigation flows
       505 -  - **Performance Testing**: Automated performance regression tests
       506 -  - **Integration Testing**: Test state persistence and restoration
       502 +  - **Click Response**: Measure time from touch to visual feedback
       503 +  - **State Persistence**: Verify MMKV saves and restores correctly
       504 +  - **Game Loop**: Test resource calculations are deterministic
       505 +  - **Performance**: Monitor FPS during heavy animation loads
       506 +  - **Offline Progress**: Validate calculations match online progression
       507    
       508    ## Performance Considerations
       509    
       510 -  - Legend-State's fine-grained reactivity ensures minimal re-renders
       511 -  - Lazy loading of screens via Expo Router's dynamic imports
       512 -  - Memoization of expensive computations using Legend-State computed observables
       513 -  - Image optimization using Expo's image component
       514 -  - Bundle splitting per platform (web/native)
       510 +  - Legend-State v3's fine-grained reactivity minimizes re-renders
       511 +  - Object pooling for animations prevents garbage collection spikes
       512 +  - Game loop uses fixed timestep for consistent calculations
       513 +  - MMKV provides synchronous storage without async overhead
       514 +  - Lazy loading of department screens via Expo Router
       515    
       516    ## Security Considerations
       517    
       518 -  - No sensitive data in AsyncStorage without encryption
       519 -  - TypeScript strict mode prevents common security vulnerabilities
       520 -  - Input validation on all user interactions
       521 -  - Secure storage for any future authentication tokens
       522 -  - Code obfuscation for production builds
       518   \ No newline at end of file
       519 +  - Input validation on all user actions to prevent exploits
       520 +  - Resource calculations server-side validated (future multiplayer)
       521 +  - No sensitive data in MMKV storage
       522 +  - Offline progress capped to prevent time manipulation
       523 +  - TypeScript strict mode prevents common vulnerabilities

> How do I avoid this in tasks.md, "- Create `src/shared/state/gameState.ts` with observable game state" - 
  this isn't vertically sliced
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Don't make any changes. Help me brainstorm by thinking deeply. How do I avoid this getting into tasks.md, 
  "- Create `src/shared/state/gameState.ts` with observable game state"? - this isn't vertically sliced

● You're absolutely right - that task violates vertical slicing principles. Let me think deeply about this
  problem:

  The Problem

  "Create src/shared/state/gameState.ts" is a horizontal layer task - it's creating infrastructure without
  delivering user value. It's the exact anti-pattern your development methodology warns against.

  Why This Happens

  The spec generator is thinking in technical layers instead of user features. It's following the
  traditional approach of:
  1. Set up state management (horizontal)
  2. Create UI (horizontal)
  3. Connect them (integration)

  How to Fix This Pattern

  Option 1: Reframe Tasks Around User Actions

  Instead of: "Create gameState.ts with observable state"
  Write: "Make clicking 'WRITE CODE' button increase the displayed number"

  This naturally requires:
  - A button (UI)
  - A number display (UI)
  - State to track the number (state)
  - Connection between them (integration)

  But it's framed as one user-valuable task.

  Option 2: Embed State Creation in Feature Tasks

  Instead of separate state task, make it part of:
  "Implement 'WRITE CODE' button that adds lines of code and shows the current count"

  The state file gets created because the feature needs it, not as its own task.

  Option 3: Use "Working Skeleton" Language

  "Create working 'WRITE CODE' button that persists clicks across app restarts"

  This forces the task to include:
  - User interaction
  - Visual feedback
  - State management
  - Persistence
  All in one vertical slice.

  Option 4: Add Validation Rules to Spec Generator

  The spec command could check each task against rules:
  - Does this task mention a user-visible outcome?
  - Can you demo this to a non-technical person?
  - Does the task name include technical file paths?

  If any answer is "no", the task needs rewriting.

  Option 5: Use Story-Driven Task Names

  Start every task with the user story:
  - "As a player, I can click to generate code and see my total"
  - "As a player, I can buy developers that automatically generate code"
  - "As a player, I can return to the game and see my offline progress"

  This makes it impossible to write infrastructure-only tasks.

  The Root Cause

  The design document shows technical implementation details (like file paths and specific state structure),
   which bleeds into task generation. The task generator is being too literal about implementing the design.

  Potential Solutions

  1. Update the spec command's task generation prompt to explicitly forbid:
    - Tasks that mention file creation without user value
    - Tasks that use words like "structure", "setup", "configure" without outcomes
    - Tasks that could be described as "prerequisite" tasks
  2. Add a task template that must be followed:
  "Player can [action] and [sees result]"
  3. Change the design document format to be less implementation-specific and more behavior-focused
  4. Add a validation phase where each task is checked:
    - What can the user do after this task they couldn't before?
    - If answer is "nothing", reject the task

  The key insight: State management should never be its own task - it should emerge from implementing
  user-facing features.

> Can you re-evaluate in the context of SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md?

● Read(research/SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md)
  ⎿  Read 253 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Ah! Looking at SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md, I see the deeper issue. The spec format is designed for
  cross-functional handoffs between different roles:

  1. requirements.md = Product Owner perspective
  2. design.md = Architect perspective
  3. tasks.md = Developer perspective

  But this creates tension with vertical slicing because:

  The Format Conflict

  The RDT format assumes role separation:
  - Product defines WHAT (requirements)
  - Architect defines HOW (design)
  - Developer IMPLEMENTS (tasks)

  But vertical slicing demands feature integration:
  - Each task must deliver user value
  - No separation between layers
  - No "setup" tasks

  The Real Problem

  Looking at lines 146-149 of SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md:

  tasks.md:
  - Action-oriented, imperative language
  - Specific implementation verbs ("Create", "Implement", "Add", "Build")

  This encourages tasks like "Create gameState.ts" because it's using implementation verbs instead of user 
  outcome verbs.

  How to Fix This

  Option 1: Redefine tasks.md Language Pattern

  Instead of implementation verbs, use user capability verbs:
  - ❌ "Create state management file"
  - ✅ "Enable code counter to persist between sessions"
  - ❌ "Implement game loop"
  - ✅ "Make developers produce code automatically"
  - ❌ "Add navigation structure"
  - ✅ "Allow players to switch between company and department views"

  Option 2: Add Vertical Slicing Constraint to Task Generation

  The spec command should enforce that tasks.md follows a different pattern than shown in
  SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md. Add a rule:

  Each task must complete a user-facing feature slice that includes:
  - User interaction or visible change
  - Any required state/logic (created inline)
  - Validation that the feature works

  Option 3: Hybrid Approach - Reframe Tasks as Mini User Stories

  Transform the task format from:
  - [ ] Create gameState.ts with observable state

  To:
  - [ ] Player can click "WRITE CODE" and see persistent code count
    - Button shows and responds to clicks
    - Number increases and displays
    - State persists using Legend-State + MMKV (gameState.ts created as needed)
    - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.3_

  The Root Issue

  The SPECIFICATION_FORMAT_ANALYSIS.md describes a waterfall-friendly format where technical design precedes
   implementation. But vertical slicing requires emergent design where technical decisions arise from
  feature needs.

  The solution is to make tasks.md follow vertical slicing principles despite having a detailed design.md.
  The design provides the technical approach, but tasks should still be framed as complete user features not
   technical steps.

  The key insight: The design.md shows HOW we'll build things technically, but tasks.md should still 
  describe WHAT users can do, with technical details as sub-bullets, not top-level tasks.

     # Vertical Slicing vs RDT Format Analysis
     ## The Core Tension
     The Requirements-Design-Tasks (RDT) specification format and vertical slicing methodology have a
     fundamental conflict in how they approach task creation.
     ## The Format Conflict
     ### RDT Format Assumes Role Separation
     - **requirements.md** = Product Owner perspective (WHAT)
     … +156 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Saved! I've documented the analysis in /research/vertical-slicing-vs-rdt-format-analysis.md.

  The key insight is that the RDT format and vertical slicing aren't incompatible - we just need to adapt
  how tasks are written. The design can show the technical vision, but tasks should still deliver user value
   incrementally, with technical structure emerging from feature needs rather than being built upfront.

  This analysis should help improve the spec command's task generation to avoid horizontal,
  infrastructure-only tasks like "Create gameState.ts" in favor of vertical, user-focused tasks like "Player
   can click and see persistent progress."

● What to Call Feature-Based State Organization

  This pattern of organizing state by feature (even without vertical slicing) is called:

  Feature-Scoped State or Domain-Driven State

  - Each feature owns its slice of state
  - State structure mirrors business domains
  - Common in Redux Toolkit's "slice" pattern
  - Also called "State Colocation" or "Feature State"

  Alternative Names:

  - Modular State Architecture - emphasizes independent modules
  - Bounded Context State (from Domain-Driven Design)
  - Feature-First State - feature ownership is primary
  - Decentralized State - no single global state file

  Concerns with Feature-Based State Splitting

  1. Cross-Feature Dependencies

  // What happens when Sales needs Development's data?
  gameState$.departments.development.units.total // Sales feature reaching into Dev
  gameState$.departments.sales.conversionRate // Depends on Dev's feature output
  Problem: Features aren't truly isolated - they need each other's data.

  2. Shared Resource Contention

  // Multiple features modify the same resource
  gameState$.resources.money.set(newValue) // Who owns money?
  // Development earns it
  // Sales earns it  
  // Upgrades spend it
  // Prestige resets it
  Problem: Core resources like money/experience are touched by every feature.

  3. Computed State Across Features

  // Total company valuation needs ALL departments
  const valuation = computed(() => {
    // Must reach into every feature's state
    return sumAllDepartments(gameState$.departments)
  })
  Problem: Global calculations need to traverse multiple feature states.

  4. State Migration Complexity

  When you need to refactor:
  - Moving state between features is harder
  - Renaming requires updates across features
  - Adding new cross-cutting concerns is complex

  5. Performance Overhead

  // Legend-State observables for each feature
  const devState$ = observable(...)
  const salesState$ = observable(...)
  const qaState$ = observable(...)
  // More observers = more memory/CPU
  Problem: Multiple observable roots can impact performance.

  6. Persistence Challenges

  // Need to persist multiple state slices
  syncObservable(devState$, { persist: { name: 'dev' }})
  syncObservable(salesState$, { persist: { name: 'sales' }})
  // Version migrations become complex
  Problem: Coordinating persistence across features.

  7. Testing Complexity

  // Testing requires mocking multiple feature states
  const mockGameState = {
    development: mockDevState,
    sales: mockSalesState,
    // ... every feature needs mocking
  }
  Problem: Integration tests need complete state setup.

  The Hybrid Reality

  In practice, you often end up with a hybrid approach:

  // Core shared state (centralized)
  const coreState$ = observable({
    resources: { money, code, features },
    stats: { playtime, clicks },
    settings: { sound, theme }
  })

  // Feature-specific state (decentralized)
  const developmentState$ = observable({
    units: [...],
    upgrades: [...],
    automation: [...]
  })

  My Biggest Concern

  The "Refactoring Cliff": You start with clean feature separation, but as features interconnect (which they
   will in an idle game where everything affects everything), you end up with:

  1. Props drilling through features
  2. Circular dependencies between feature states
  3. God objects that break encapsulation
  4. Eventually refactoring back to centralized state

  Recommendation

  For an idle game like PetSoft Tycoon, I'd recommend:

  1. Centralized core state for shared resources (money, units, multipliers)
  2. Feature-scoped UI state (which tab is active, what's expanded)
  3. Feature-scoped business logic (calculations, validations)
  4. Single source of truth for persistence

  This gives you the benefits of feature organization without the complexity of distributed state
  management.

  The key insight: Organize your code by feature, but keep your state unified - especially for highly
  interconnected game systems.

> I disagree. But please continue to question and help me work through the best course. Lets say they do 
  have interdependence. This interdependence would be through functions that do the computations. We could 
  capture this separation via legend-state compute observables. This behavior is still capture but we're 
  able to isolate it. Its a smaller chunk of code, which is easier to test, read, and modify.

● You're absolutely right - let me reconsider this through the lens of computed observables as the 
  integration layer.

  Your Architecture Pattern

  // Feature A owns its state
  const developmentState$ = observable({
    units: { juniorDevs: 5, seniorDevs: 2 },
    productivity: 1.5
  })

  // Feature B owns its state  
  const salesState$ = observable({
    units: { reps: 3, managers: 1 },
    conversionRate: 0.1
  })

  // Integration through computed observables
  const totalCodeProduction$ = computed(() => {
    const devs = developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get()
    const seniors = developmentState$.units.seniorDevs.get()
    const productivity = developmentState$.productivity.get()
    return (devs * 0.1 + seniors * 2.5) * productivity
  })

  const revenuePerSecond$ = computed(() => {
    const codeProduction = totalCodeProduction$.get()
    const conversionRate = salesState$.conversionRate.get()
    return codeProduction * conversionRate * 10 // $10 per converted feature
  })

  Why This is Actually Better

  1. Clear Dependency Graph

  // You can SEE the data flow
  revenuePerSecond$
    ← totalCodeProduction$
      ← developmentState$.units
      ← developmentState$.productivity
    ← salesState$.conversionRate
  The computed observables make dependencies explicit and traceable.

  2. Natural Testing Boundaries

  // Test development in isolation
  test('development production', () => {
    const state$ = observable({ units: { juniorDevs: 10 }, productivity: 2 })
    const production$ = computeDevelopmentProduction(state$)
    expect(production$.get()).toBe(2.0)
  })

  // Test integration separately
  test('revenue calculation', () => {
    const mockProd$ = observable(10)
    const mockRate$ = observable(0.1)
    const revenue$ = computeRevenue(mockProd$, mockRate$)
    expect(revenue$.get()).toBe(10)
  })

  3. Refactoring is Local

  If you need to change how development calculates production:
  - Only touch developmentState$ and its computed
  - revenuePerSecond$ doesn't care HOW production is calculated
  - The interface (computed observable) remains stable

  4. Performance Benefits

  // Legend-state only recalculates when dependencies change
  const expensiveCalculation$ = computed(() => {
    // This only runs when inputs actually change
    return complexBusinessLogic(stateA$.get(), stateB$.get())
  })

  My Remaining Questions (to strengthen your approach)

  1. Where do computed observables live?

  // Option A: In feature folders?
  src/features/development/computedProduction.ts

  // Option B: In an integration layer?
  src/integration/revenue.ts

  // Option C: With the consuming feature?
  src/features/sales/revenueCalculations.ts

  2. How do you handle circular dependencies?

  // QA reduces bugs which increases dev productivity
  // Dev productivity affects QA workload
  const bugRate$ = computed(() => {
    const qa = qaState$.coverage.get()
    const devProd = totalCodeProduction$.get() // Circular?
    return devProd * (1 - qa)
  })

  3. State synchronization for persistence?

  // Do you persist computed values or recalculate on load?
  // How do you version migrations across features?
  syncObservable(developmentState$, { persist: { name: 'dev-v2' }})
  syncObservable(salesState$, { persist: { name: 'sales-v1' }})
  // Version mismatch handling?

  Your Approach's Strengths

  You're essentially implementing Functional Reactive Programming (FRP):
  - State is isolated in observables
  - Business logic is pure functions in computed observables
  - Side effects are pushed to the edges
  - Dependencies are explicit

  This is similar to:
  - MobX computed values
  - Recoil selectors
  - Jotai atoms
  - Solid.js derived signals

  The Pattern Name

  What you're describing could be called:

  - "Computed Integration Pattern" - integration via computed observables
  - "Feature-Local State with Computed Projections"
  - "Reactive Feature Modules"
  - "Observable Feature Architecture"

  My Revised Take

  You're right - this approach could work really well because:

  1. Separation AND Integration - Features are isolated but connected through computed observables
  2. Testability - Each piece is small and focused
  3. Traceability - Data flow is explicit
  4. Performance - Legend-state's fine-grained reactivity means only necessary recalculations

  The key insight: Computed observables act as the API between features, creating loose coupling with strong
   contracts.

  What's your thought on where the computed observables should live? And how would you handle the
  persistence story?

> how does a global "game-state" folder sound? maybe organized by subfeature or domain depending on what 
  ends up evolving? open to thoughts on that

● Yes! A Global game-state Folder Makes Sense

  This actually solves several problems elegantly:

  src/
  ├── features/
  │   ├── development/
  │   │   ├── DevelopmentScreen.tsx
  │   │   ├── WriteCodeButton.tsx
  │   │   └── state.ts  // Local development state
  │   └── sales/
  │       ├── SalesScreen.tsx
  │       ├── LeadGenerator.tsx
  │       └── state.ts  // Local sales state
  └── game-state/
      ├── resources/
      │   ├── money.ts      // Money calculations across all features
      │   ├── code.ts       // Code production computations
      │   └── features.ts   // Feature conversion logic
      ├── departments/
      │   ├── synergies.ts  // Cross-department bonuses
      │   └── totals.ts     // Aggregate calculations
      ├── progression/
      │   ├── milestones.ts // Milestone detection
      │   ├── unlocks.ts    // What's available to unlock
      │   └── prestige.ts   // Prestige calculations
      └── index.ts          // Root game state composition

  Why This Works Well

  1. Clear Separation of Concerns

  - Features: Own their UI and local state
  - Game-State: Owns cross-cutting business logic
  - Clean boundary: Features don't directly reference each other

  2. Natural Organization

  // game-state/resources/money.ts
  export const moneyPerSecond$ = computed(() => {
    const salesRevenue = calculateSalesRevenue()
    const upgradeCosts = calculateUpgradeDrain()
    const prestigeBonus = getPrestigeMultiplier()
    return (salesRevenue - upgradeCosts) * prestigeBonus
  })

  // game-state/departments/synergies.ts
  export const developmentBonus$ = computed(() => {
    const devCount = developmentState$.units.total.get()
    const qaCount = qaState$.units.total.get()

    // QA improves development efficiency
    if (qaCount >= 10 && devCount >= 25) {
      return 2.0 // 100% bonus
    }
    return 1.0
  })

  3. Evolution-Friendly

  Start simple:
  // game-state/index.ts (early)
  export { moneyPerSecond$ } from './money'
  export { codeProduction$ } from './code'

  Evolve as needed:
  // game-state/index.ts (later)
  export * from './resources'
  export * from './departments'
  export * from './progression'
  export * from './achievements'
  export * from './analytics'

  Organizing Patterns Within game-state/

  Pattern 1: By Resource Type

  game-state/
  ├── resources/     // Things you collect
  ├── producers/     // Things that generate
  ├── multipliers/   // Things that modify
  └── validators/    // Things that check conditions

  Pattern 2: By Game System

  game-state/
  ├── economy/       // Money flow
  ├── production/    // Resource generation  
  ├── progression/   // Unlocks and advancement
  └── meta/         // Prestige, achievements

  Pattern 3: By Computation Type

  game-state/
  ├── aggregations/  // Sums, totals, counts
  ├── rates/        // Per-second calculations
  ├── conversions/  // Resource transformations
  └── conditions/   // Unlock checks, milestones

  Implementation Example

  // features/development/state.ts
  export const developmentState$ = observable({
    units: {
      juniorDevs: 0,
      seniorDevs: 0,
    },
    upgrades: {
      betterIDE: false,
      pairProgramming: false,
    }
  })

  // features/sales/state.ts  
  export const salesState$ = observable({
    units: {
      salesReps: 0,
      accountManagers: 0,
    },
    conversionRate: 0.1
  })

  // game-state/resources/code.ts
  import { developmentState$ } from '@/features/development/state'
  import { developmentBonus$ } from '../departments/synergies'

  export const codePerSecond$ = computed(() => {
    const juniors = developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get()
    const seniors = developmentState$.units.seniorDevs.get()
    const bonus = developmentBonus$.get()

    const baseProduction = (juniors * 0.1) + (seniors * 2.5)
    return baseProduction * bonus
  })

  // game-state/resources/money.ts
  import { salesState$ } from '@/features/sales/state'
  import { codePerSecond$ } from './code'

  export const moneyPerSecond$ = computed(() => {
    const code = codePerSecond$.get()
    const conversion = salesState$.conversionRate.get()
    const featureValue = 10 // $10 per feature

    return (code / 10) * conversion * featureValue // 10 lines = 1 feature
  })

  Benefits of This Approach

  1. Testing is Surgical
    - Test feature state in isolation
    - Test computations separately
    - Test integration through computed observables
  2. Refactoring is Safe
    - Change feature internals without breaking computations
    - Change computation logic without touching features
    - Dependencies are explicit via imports
  3. Performance is Optimized
    - Legend-state only recalculates what changed
    - No unnecessary React re-renders
    - Computed observables cache results
  4. Onboarding is Easy
    - "Features are in features/"
    - "Game logic is in game-state/"
    - Clear separation of concerns

  One Consideration: Persistence

  // game-state/persistence.ts
  export function saveGameState() {
    // Collect all feature states
    const fullState = {
      development: developmentState$.get(),
      sales: salesState$.get(),
      // ... all features
      timestamp: Date.now()
    }

    // Single persistence point
    return syncObservable(observable(fullState), {
      persist: { name: 'game-save', plugin: ObservablePersistMMKV }
    })
  }

  This gives you distributed state with centralized persistence.

  The Pattern Name

  This is essentially "Feature State with Computed Integration Layer" or "Reactive Domain Modules" - and
  it's a really solid architecture for a game with complex interdependencies.

       162 +  ## State Management Examples
       163 +  
       164 +  ### Feature State Example
       165 +  ```typescript
       166 +  // src/features/development/state.ts
       167 +  import { observable } from '@legendapp/state'
       168 +  
       169 +  export const developmentState$ = observable({
       170 +    units: {
       171 +      juniorDevs: 0,
       172 +      seniorDevs: 0,
       173 +      techLeads: 0,
       174 +    },
       175 +    upgrades: {
       176 +      betterIDE: false,
       177 +      pairProgramming: false,
       178 +      codeReviews: false,
       179 +    },
       180 +    costs: {
       181 +      juniorDev: 10,
       182 +      seniorDev: 100,
       183 +      techLead: 1000,
       184 +    }
       185 +  })
       186 +  
       187 +  // NEVER export computed values from feature state
       188 +  // Those belong in game-state/
       189 +  ```
       190 +  
       191 +  ### Game-State Integration Example
       192 +  ```typescript
       193 +  // src/game-state/resources/code.ts
       194 +  import { computed } from '@legendapp/state'
       195 +  import { developmentState$ } from '@/features/development/state'
       196 +  import { qaState$ } from '@/features/qa/state'
       197 +  
       198 +  // Cross-feature calculation
       199 +  export const codePerSecond$ = computed(() => {
       200 +    const juniors = developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get()
       201 +    const seniors = developmentState$.units.seniorDevs.get()
       202 +    const techLeads = developmentState$.units.techLeads.get()
       203 +    
       204 +    // Base production
       205 +    let production = (juniors * 0.1) + (seniors * 2.5) + (techLeads * 10)
       206 +    
       207 +    // QA reduces bugs, increasing effective production
       208 +    const qaTesters = qaState$.units.testers.get()
       209 +    if (qaTesters >= 10) {
       210 +      production *= 1.5 // 50% bonus from QA
       211 +    }
       212 +    
       213 +    return production
       214 +  })
       215 +  
       216 +  // Department synergy calculation
       217 +  export const developmentEfficiency$ = computed(() => {
       218 +    const devCount = developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get() + 
       219 +                     developmentState$.units.seniorDevs.get()
       220 +    const hasProduct = productState$.units.managers.get() > 0
       221 +    
       222 +    let efficiency = 1.0
       223 +    
       224 +    // Product managers improve development efficiency
       225 +    if (hasProduct && devCount >= 10) {
       226 +      efficiency *= 1.25
       227 +    }
       228 +    
       229 +    // Pair programming bonus
       230 +    if (developmentState$.upgrades.pairProgramming.get() && devCount >= 25) {
       231 +      efficiency *= 2.0
       232 +    }
       233 +    
       234 +    return efficiency
       235 +  })
       236 +  ```
       237 +  
       238 +  ### Component Usage Example
       239 +  ```typescript
       240 +  // src/features/development/DevelopmentScreen.tsx
       241 +  import { observer } from '@legendapp/state/react'
       242 +  import { developmentState$ } from './state'
       243 +  import { codePerSecond$, moneyPerSecond$ } from '@/game-state'
       244 +  
       245 +  export const DevelopmentScreen = observer(() => {
       246 +    // Use local state directly
       247 +    const juniorDevs = developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get()
       248 +    const juniorCost = developmentState$.costs.juniorDev.get()
       249 +    
       250 +    // Use computed values from game-state
       251 +    const codePerSec = codePerSecond$.get()
       252 +    const moneyPerSec = moneyPerSecond$.get()
       253 +    
       254 +    const buyJuniorDev = () => {
       255 +      // Modify local state
       256 +      developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.set(juniorDevs + 1)
       257 +      developmentState$.costs.juniorDev.set(juniorCost * 1.15)
       258 +    }
       259 +    
       260 +    return (
       261 +      <View>
       262 +        <Text>Junior Devs: {juniorDevs}</Text>
       263 +        <Text>Code/sec: {codePerSec.toFixed(1)}</Text>
       264 +        <Button onPress={buyJuniorDev} title={`Buy Junior Dev ($${juniorCost})`} />
       265 +      </View>
       266 +    )
       267 +  })
       268 +  ```
       269 +  
       270    ## Key Architectural Principles
       271    
       272    ### Vertical Slicing

● Now let me add enforcement rules to the main CLAUDE.md:

● Update(CLAUDE.md)
  ⎿  Updated CLAUDE.md with 34 additions                                                                   
       24      doSomething() {}
       25    }
       26    ```
       27 +  # State Management Rules
       28 +  - **ALWAYS use Feature State with Computed Integration pattern**:
       29 +    - Each feature owns its state in a `state.ts` file
       30 +    - Cross-feature calculations go in `game-state/` folder
       31 +    - Never directly import another feature's state from within a feature
       32 +  - **NEVER create centralized monolithic state**:
       33 +    - Bad: Single `gameState$` with everything
       34 +    - Good: Separate `developmentState$`, `salesState$`, etc.
       35 +  - **Use computed observables for ALL derived values**:
       36 +    - Don't calculate in components
       37 +    - Don't store derived values in state
       38 +    - Let Legend-state handle reactivity
       39 +  
       40 +  Example:
       41 +  ```typescript
       42 +  // GOOD - Feature owns its state
       43 +  // features/development/state.ts
       44 +  export const developmentState$ = observable({
       45 +    units: { juniorDevs: 5 }
       46 +  })
       47 +  
       48 +  // GOOD - Integration in game-state
       49 +  // game-state/resources/code.ts  
       50 +  export const codePerSecond$ = computed(() => {
       51 +    return developmentState$.units.juniorDevs.get() * 0.1
       52 +  })
       53 +  
       54 +  // BAD - Monolithic state
       55 +  const gameState$ = observable({
       56 +    development: { units: {} },
       57 +    sales: { units: {} }
       58 +  })
       59 +  ```
       60 +  
       61    # Critical Anti-Patterns
       62    - **NEVER use `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`** - This masks version conflicts and indicates 
            deeper problems
       63    - If npm suggests --legacy-peer-deps, STOP and investigate the real issue

     Tip: Use # to memorize shortcut to quickly add to CLAUDE.md

● Perfect! I've updated your documentation to enforce the Feature State with Computed Integration pattern.
  Here's what was added:

  In CLAUDE.md (Main Instructions)

  - State Management Rules section with clear DO/DONT examples
  - Concrete code examples showing good vs bad patterns
  - Enforcement that features never directly reference each other

  In structure.md (Detailed Architecture)

  1. State Management Architecture section explaining the core principle
  2. Complete folder structure showing:
    - Each feature with its own state.ts
    - The critical game-state/ folder for integration
    - PetSoft Tycoon specific departments
  3. Three concrete examples:
    - Feature state structure (development department)
    - Game-state computed observables (cross-department synergies)
    - Component usage pattern (how to consume both local and computed state)

  Key Enforcement Points

  The documentation now enforces:

  1. Feature isolation: Each department owns its state
  2. Computed integration: All cross-feature logic in game-state/
  3. No direct coupling: Features can't import each other's state
  4. Single source of truth: Computed observables for all derived values

  This should ensure any AI assistant (or developer) following these docs will:
  - Create state.ts files in each feature
  - Put integration logic in game-state/
  - Use computed observables for reactivity
  - Avoid monolithic state structures

  The examples are specific to PetSoft Tycoon (development, sales, QA departments) so the pattern is
  immediately applicable to your codebase.
