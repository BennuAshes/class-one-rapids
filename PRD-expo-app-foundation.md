# Product Requirements Document: Expo App Foundation

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for establishing a foundational Expo React Native application that serves as a scalable starting point for feature development. The app will provide essential infrastructure including navigation, state management, and development tooling while maintaining cross-platform compatibility for iOS, Android, and web platforms.

### Business Context
Building a solid foundation for mobile application development accelerates time-to-market for new features while ensuring consistent user experiences across platforms. A well-structured Expo app foundation reduces technical debt, improves developer productivity, and provides a reliable base for iterative feature development.

### Problem Statement
Teams need a production-ready mobile application foundation that eliminates setup complexity, provides modern development patterns, and supports rapid feature iteration without compromising code quality or performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Cross-Platform Application Setup
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured Expo application with TypeScript support, so that I can build type-safe features across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN the application is initialized THEN it runs successfully on iOS simulator, Android emulator, and web browser
- WHEN TypeScript files are created THEN type checking and intellisense work correctly
- WHEN the build process runs THEN it produces platform-specific bundles without errors
- IF a platform-specific issue occurs THEN clear error messages guide resolution

### Requirement 2: Navigation Infrastructure
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a navigation system with tab and stack navigation, so that I can easily add new screens and maintain consistent navigation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN the app launches THEN a tab bar with at least 3 tabs is visible
- WHEN a tab is selected THEN the corresponding screen renders correctly
- WHEN navigating between screens THEN transitions are smooth and state is preserved
- IF deep linking is configured THEN URLs map correctly to app screens

### Requirement 3: State Management Foundation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured state management solution, so that I can manage application state efficiently and predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN state is updated THEN dependent components re-render automatically
- WHEN the app is refreshed THEN critical state persists appropriately
- WHEN async operations occur THEN loading and error states are handled consistently
- IF multiple components access the same state THEN updates are synchronized

### Requirement 4: Development Environment
**User Story:** As a developer, I want configured linting, formatting, and testing tools, so that I can maintain code quality and catch issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- WHEN code is saved THEN it is automatically formatted according to project standards
- WHEN the lint command runs THEN code style violations are identified
- WHEN tests are executed THEN they run successfully with coverage reporting
- IF pre-commit hooks are configured THEN they validate code before commits

## Success Metrics

- Application successfully builds and runs on all target platforms within 5 minutes of cloning
- Developer can add a new screen with navigation in under 10 minutes
- Hot reload functionality works consistently across all platforms

## Out of Scope

- User authentication and authorization systems
- Backend API integration and data fetching logic
- Complex animations and gesture handling
- Push notification infrastructure
- In-app purchase functionality
- Analytics and crash reporting setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- App store deployment configuration
