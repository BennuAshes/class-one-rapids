# TODO - Project Implementation Notes

## üîß Technical Research Needed

### 1. ESLint Configuration Research
- Research proper ESLint setup for React Native + Expo + TypeScript projects
- Investigate ESLint flat config vs traditional .eslintrc
- Determine compatibility with Expo SDK 52 and React Native 0.76
- Document recommended rules and plugins for this tech stack
- Consider integration with Prettier for code formatting

### 2. Self-Correcting Error Handling System
- Create an error recovery mechanism for the development workflow
- When errors occur during implementation:
  - Capture full error context (command, output, environment)
  - Save to structured error log file (e.g., `errors/error-{timestamp}.json`)
  - Analyze error patterns and determine fixes
  - **UPDATE RESEARCH FILES**: Auto-update relevant files in `research/` based on solutions
  - Implement retry logic with corrections
- Self-updating system that improves `research/` files rather than separate knowledge base
- Research files auto-update ‚Üí quick-ref.md regenerates ‚Üí future runs avoid same errors

## üìù Implementation Ideas

### Error Recovery System Structure
```
errors/
  error-2025-08-10-001.json  # Structured error capture
  recovery-log.md             # Human-readable recovery attempts
  
research/tech/                # Auto-updated with solutions
  react-native.md            # Updated when RN errors are solved
  expo.md                    # Updated when Expo errors are solved  
  typescript.md              # Updated when TS errors are solved
  eslint.md                  # NEW - Created from ESLint research
```

### ESLint Research Topics
- `eslint-config-expo` compatibility
- TypeScript ESLint parser configuration
- React Native specific rules
- Performance impact of different rule sets
- Integration with VS Code and other IDEs

## üéØ Action Items
1. [ ] Research and document ESLint best practices in `research/tech/eslint.md`
2. [ ] Design error recovery system that updates research files
3. [ ] Implement error capture mechanism
4. [ ] Create diagnostic tooling for common issues
5. [ ] Build auto-update system for research files (feeds into quick-ref.md)

## üîí Human Gates for Research Updates

### Option 1: Staged Updates with Review
```
Error ‚Üí Capture ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí PROPOSED update (staged) ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Commit to research/
```
- Error solutions go to `research/proposed/` or `research/pending/`
- Human reviews and moves to actual `research/tech/`
- Quick-ref only regenerates from approved research

### Option 2: PR-Based Workflow
```
Error ‚Üí Auto-create branch ‚Üí Update research files ‚Üí Open PR ‚Üí Human Review ‚Üí Merge
```
- Each error fix creates a PR with research updates
- Human reviews the proposed changes
- Can batch multiple fixes into one PR
- Git history tracks all learning

### Option 3: Confidence-Based Gates
```
High confidence fixes (version bumps) ‚Üí Auto-update
Medium confidence (config changes) ‚Üí Stage for review  
Low confidence (architectural changes) ‚Üí Require human approval
```

### Option 4: Review Queue
```
errors/
  pending-review/
    2025-08-10-npm-fix.md     # Proposed research update
    2025-08-10-eslint-fix.md  # Another proposed update
  approved/
    [moves here after review]
```

**Recommendation**: PR approach is probably cleanest since:
- Version control built-in
- Review process already familiar
- Can see diffs clearly
- Rollback is easy
- Can add CI checks
