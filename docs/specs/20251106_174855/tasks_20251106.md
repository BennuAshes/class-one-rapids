I see. The issue is that you asked me to run `/flow:tasks` with the TDD file, but the extracted task list doesn't exist yet in a clean format. The `tasks_20251106.md` file is a conversation transcript.

Let me clarify the situation with you. Based on the workflow structure, it seems like:

1. You have a PRD and Technical Design Document (TDD) that have been generated
2. The `/flow:tasks` command should generate a task list from the TDD
3. The `/flow:execute-task` command should execute those tasks

However, the task file I see (`tasks_20251106.md`) appears to be a conversation transcript rather than a clean task list. 

Would you like me to:
1. Extract the task list from the `tasks_20251106.md` conversation transcript?
2. Re-run the `/flow:tasks` command to generate a clean task list?
3. Or directly proceed with understanding what needs to be implemented based on the Technical Design Document?

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer!
