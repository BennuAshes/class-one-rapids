The tasks file also contains execution logs. Based on the workflow status, it seems the workflow needs to complete the "Generate Task List" step. 

I have two options here:

1. **Generate the task list from the TDD** - Run `/flow:tasks` with the TDD file to create a clean task list
2. **Try to extract tasks from the existing file** - Attempt to parse out the actual task content

Which would you like me to do? Or did you intend for me to complete the workflow by:
1. First generating clean tasks from the TDD (`/flow:tasks`)
2. Then executing those tasks (`/flow:execute-task`)

Please clarify how you'd like me to proceed!
