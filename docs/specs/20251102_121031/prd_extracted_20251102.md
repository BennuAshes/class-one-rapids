I'll generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document for the feature described in the arguments.

First, let me identify what feature description was provided:

The arguments appear to be empty or just referencing the lean task generation guide. Let me check if there's a specific feature description you'd like me to create a PRD for.

Could you please provide the feature description? You can either:
1. Provide it directly as text (e.g., "Build a user authentication system with OAuth")
2. Provide a path to a file containing the feature description

For example:
- `/flow:prd Build a real-time chat feature for mobile app`
- `/flow:prd docs/features/analytics-dashboard.md`

Once you provide the feature description, I'll generate a complete, lean PRD following the principles in the lean task generation guide.
