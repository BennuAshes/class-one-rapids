I see - the `tasks_20251104.md` file is still growing and contains the conversation transcript from the `/flow:tasks` command execution. This means the workflow is currently running the task generation step. 

It appears you're currently executing me ("/flow:execute-task") while the workflow is still in the middle of generating the tasks. The workflow follows this sequence:

1. ✅ Generate PRD - Completed
2. ✅ Generate Technical Design - Completed  
3. ⏳ Generate Task List - **Currently Running**
4. ⏸️ Execute Tasks - Pending (this is what you're trying to run now)
5. ⏸️ Generate Summary - Pending

**The issue:** You've invoked `/flow:execute-task` before the task list generation has completed. The workflow script should automatically proceed to task execution once the task list is generated.

**Recommendation:** Wait for the workflow to complete the "Generate Task List" step. You can monitor progress by:

```bash
watch -n 5 'tail -20 /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/workflow-outputs/20251104_223542/workflow-status.json'
```

Or check the size of the tasks file to see if it's still growing:

```bash
ls -lh /mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/workflow-outputs/20251104_223542/tasks_20251104.md
```

Once the "Generate Task List" step shows "completed" in the workflow status, the workflow will automatically proceed to execute the tasks, or you can manually trigger `/flow:execute-task` with the proper task list file path.

Would you like me to:
1. Wait and monitor the workflow progress?
2. Check if the workflow process is stuck?
3. Do something else?
