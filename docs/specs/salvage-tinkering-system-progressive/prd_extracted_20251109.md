# Salvage & Tinkering System - Progressive Automation Design

## Core Philosophy: Manual → Semi-Auto → Full Automation

The system follows the proven idle game pattern of starting with satisfying manual actions that gradually unlock automation, making each automation upgrade feel like a meaningful achievement rather than removing gameplay.

## Progression Phases Overview

### Phase 1: Manual Crafting (Levels 1-10)
- **Player Action**: Click each item to salvage
- **Satisfaction**: Direct cause-and-effect, learning materials
- **Goal**: Understand the system, feel the rewards

### Phase 2: Assisted Automation (Levels 11-25)
- **Player Action**: Batch processing, queue management
- **Satisfaction**: Efficiency gains, strategic choices
- **Goal**: Optimize throughput, unlock auto-features

### Phase 3: Full Automation (Levels 26+)
- **Player Action**: Strategic settings, prestige decisions
- **Satisfaction**: Big number watching, optimization
- **Goal**: Perfect the machine, push boundaries

## Detailed Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Manual Crafting (Tutorial → Level 10)
**"Every Click Matters"**

#### Salvaging Mechanics
```
Player Flow:
1. Click item in inventory → Salvage animation (0.5 sec)
2. Materials burst out → Collect by clicking or auto-collect after 2 sec
3. Materials add to counter with satisfying number popup
4. Empty slot ready for next item
```

**Early Satisfaction Loops:**
- Each click produces visible materials
- Different items produce different colored particles
- Rare materials create screen flash and special sound
- Material counter grows with each action

#### Tinkering Introduction
```
Manual Process:
1. Drag materials to equipment piece
2. Hold button to "channel" upgrade (2 seconds)
3. Success animation shows +1 on item
4. Power level increases visibly
```

**No Failure at This Stage:**
- 100% success rate to build confidence
- Cost increases but always achievable
- Clear progress per action

#### First Automation Unlocks
**Level 5: Auto-Collect**
- Materials automatically fly to inventory after 0.5 seconds
- Feels like first "upgrade" to efficiency

**Level 8: Batch Select**
- Shift-click to select multiple items
- "Salvage All Selected" button appears
- Still manual but more efficient

**Level 10: The Assistant**
- Unlock first automation: "Salvage Assistant"
- Salvages 1 item every 3 seconds
- Player can still click to go faster
- Major milestone celebration

### Phase 2: Assisted Automation (Levels 11-25)
**"Building Your Empire"**

#### Automation Upgrades (Unlock Tree)

**Salvage Automation Line:**
```
Level 11: Basic Assistant (1 item/3 sec)
    ↓
Level 13: Skilled Assistant (1 item/2 sec)
    ↓
Level 15: Expert Assistant (1 item/1 sec)
    ↓
Level 18: Salvage Team (3 items/sec)
    ↓
Level 22: Salvage Factory (10 items/sec)
```

**Tinkering Automation Line:**
```
Level 12: Auto-Tinker Toggle
- Automatically uses materials when available
- Player sets target item
- Visual progress bar fills

Level 16: Priority System
- Set priority order for equipment
- Materials distributed automatically
- Can override with manual tinkering

Level 20: Smart Tinkering
- AI suggests optimal distribution
- One-click to accept suggestion
- Learn patterns from player choices
```

#### Hybrid Gameplay
**Player Still Actively Engaged:**
- **Click Bonuses**: Manual clicks 2x faster than automation
- **Combo System**: Click 10 items quickly for speed burst
- **Critical Clicks**: 5% chance for 5x materials on manual salvage
- **Active Tinkering**: Manual tinkering 50% cheaper than auto

**Strategic Decisions:**
- Which automation to upgrade next
- When to manual boost vs idle
- Resource allocation between paths
- Setting automation priorities

#### New Systems Introduced
**Material Refinement (Level 15):**
- Combine 3 common → 1 rare (manual at first)
- Unlocks auto-refiner at Level 20

**Salvage Filters (Level 18):**
- Set rules: "Auto-salvage commons"
- Keep control over valuable items
- Gradually trust the system more

### Phase 3: Full Automation (Level 26+)
**"Optimization Paradise"**

#### Complete Automation Unlocks

**Level 26: Master Salvager**
- Process up to 100 items/second
- Queue holds 10,000 items
- Offline progression activated
- Materials accumulate while away

**Level 30: Grand Tinkermaster**
- Manages all equipment simultaneously
- Predictive AI enhancement
- Perfect material distribution
- No waste guarantee

#### Advanced Systems

**Prestige Salvaging (Level 35):**
```
Every 1000 items salvaged:
- Choose 1 of 3 bonuses:
  * +10% all materials for 1 hour
  * Next 100 salvages guaranteed rare
  * Double tinkering speed for 30 min
```

**Forge Mastery (Level 40):**
- Automated forge cycles every 2 hours
- Player chooses focus before each cycle
- Results apply across all equipment
- Massive power spikes

**The Clicking Endgame:**
- **God Click**: Manual click processes 1000 items instantly (1hr cooldown)
- **Perfect Salvage**: Manual salvage has 50% chance for legendary materials
- **Master's Touch**: Manual tinkering can exceed normal limits
- Clicking remains relevant but optional

## UI Evolution Through Phases

## Progression Pacing

### Time to Automation Milestones
- **First Auto-Salvage**: 15-20 minutes (Level 10)
- **Meaningful Automation**: 1-2 hours (Level 15)
- **Mostly Automated**: 5-8 hours (Level 25)
- **Full Automation**: 15-20 hours (Level 30)
- **Optimization Phase**: 20+ hours (Level 35+)

### Why This Works
1. **Investment Before Automation**: Players understand and value what they're automating
2. **Gradual Trust Building**: Slowly hand over control as confidence grows
3. **Maintained Agency**: Can always click for bonuses/speed
4. **Clear Progression**: Each automation feels earned and impactful
5. **Depth Revelation**: Complexity appears just as previous layer becomes routine

## Key Design Principles

1. **Respect the Click**: Manual action always has value, even in late game
2. **Earned Automation**: Each automation is a reward, not a given
3. **Progressive Complexity**: New systems appear as old ones become routine
4. **Player Agency**: Automation assists, never replaces decision-making
5. **Satisfaction First**: Every interaction produces positive feedback

## Conclusion

This progressive system captures the best of both worlds:
- **Early Game**: The tactile satisfaction of Asheron's Call's manual crafting
- **Mid Game**: The strategic depth of management games
- **Late Game**: The optimization paradise of idle games

Players experience the full journey from "I did this" to "I built this" to "Look what I've created," maintaining engagement through natural progression rather than forced complexity. The system teaches through action, rewards through automation, and retains through optimization - the perfect idle game progression.
