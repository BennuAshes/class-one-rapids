Perfect! I found a comprehensive task list for the Salvage & Tinkering System. This is a well-structured TDD-based implementation plan with 5 detailed tasks for Phase 1.

The task list includes:
1. **Task 1.1**: Test Infrastructure Setup
2. **Task 1.2**: Implement First User-Visible Feature - Manual Salvage (TDD)
3. **Task 1.3**: Material State Management with Legend State (TDD)
4. **Task 1.4**: Material Counter UI Component (TDD)
5. **Task 1.5**: Complete Salvage Screen - First Playable MVP (TDD)

Since you asked me to execute tasks from this task list using `/flow:execute-task`, I should note that this slash command expects a task list file path and an optional task ID or phase name. However, this is a comprehensive task document that I can work through.

Would you like me to:

1. **Execute all tasks in Phase 1 sequentially** (Tasks 1.1 through 1.5)?
2. **Execute a specific task** (e.g., Task 1.1, Task 1.2, etc.)?
3. **Start with just the first task** (Task 1.1: Test Infrastructure Setup)?

Please let me know which approach you'd prefer, and I'll proceed with implementing the tasks using the TDD methodology outlined in the document.
