# Player Power Progression System

## Feature Overview
Implement the core player progression mechanic centered around a single "Power" attribute that continuously increases, providing the fundamental sense of growth and achievement in Asheron's Call Idler. This simplified progression system follows the MVP principle of "One perfect mechanic" before adding complexity.

## Key Requirements
- Single Power attribute that affects all combat calculations
- Experience points (XP) gained from defeating enemies
- Automatic level progression with Power increases
- Power-based damage calculation replacing random damage
- Visual Power display showing current level and progress
- Persistent Power state that carries between sessions
- Exponential XP curve for satisfying long-term progression

## Core Mechanics

### Power Attribute
- Starts at 1
- Increases by 1 every level
- Directly multiplies base damage (Power × base damage)
- No other stats initially (following MVP's "Flatten Early Progression")

### Experience System
- Each enemy defeated grants XP based on enemy level
- XP requirement increases exponentially: Level N requires (N × 100) XP
- Visual progress bar fills showing proximity to next level
- "LEVEL UP!" celebration animation with particles

### Damage Calculation
Replace current random damage (50-100) with:
```
damage = Power × (10 + random(0-5))
```
This provides predictable progression while maintaining some variance.

### Pyreal Integration
- Pyreal rewards scale with enemy level (enemy level × 5 Pyreal)
- Future: Pyreal can be spent on Power boosts (not in initial implementation)

## Technical Scope
- Add Power and XP state management to existing App.tsx
- Modify damage calculation to use Power attribute
- Create level-up detection and celebration system
- Add Power/Level UI display
- Implement XP bar with smooth fill animations
- Add AsyncStorage persistence for Power/XP/Level
- Scale enemy health with player level for maintained challenge

## User Interface
```
[Power: 15]  [Level 15]
[===========>        ] XP: 750/1500

[Enemy Health Bar]
[ENEMY]

[Pyreal: 1,250]
```

## Success Criteria
- Players immediately understand Power makes them stronger
- Level progression feels rewarding and frequent early on
- Damage numbers visibly increase with Power
- Clear visual feedback on level-up
- Progress persists between app sessions
- Maintains the "involuntary smile" from increased damage

## Implementation Priority
1. Power state and damage calculation (Core loop)
2. XP gain and level progression (Progression feeling)
3. UI displays for Power/Level/XP (Visibility)
4. Level-up celebration (Polish)
5. Persistence with AsyncStorage (Retention)
6. Enemy scaling (Long-term balance)

## Dependencies
- Existing combat system (✅ Completed)
- Pyreal currency system (✅ Completed)
- React Native AsyncStorage for persistence

## Out of Scope (Future Iterations)
- Additional attributes (Coordination, Endurance)
- Skill trees or specializations
- Power boost purchases with Pyreal
- Prestige/Portal system
- Offline XP generation

## Priority
**CRITICAL** - This provides the core progression loop that makes idle games compelling. Without Power progression, players have no sense of growth despite collecting currency. This is the #2 feature in the MVP's Week 1 MUST HAVE list.
