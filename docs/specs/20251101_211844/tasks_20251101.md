I can see this is getting recursive - the tasks file is also a log of the failed `/flow:tasks` command execution! The entire workflow chain failed because the initial `/flow:prd` command didn't receive a feature description.

## Summary

The workflow run at `20251101_211844` **completely failed** because:

1. `/flow:prd` was called with no feature description argument
2. This caused PRD generation to fail with an error message
3. `/flow:design` then tried to read the failed PRD and also failed
4. `/flow:tasks` tried to read the failed TDD and also failed

All the files in this directory (`prd_20251101.md`, `tdd_20251101.md`, `tasks_20251101.md`) contain execution logs showing error messages, not actual content.

## What you should do

You have several options to move forward:

### Option 1: Use an existing complete PRD
You have several working PRDs in your `docs/specs/` directory:
- `/docs/specs/core-combat-tap/` - Core combat tap mechanic
- `/docs/specs/offline-progression/` - Offline progression system
- `/docs/specs/player-power-progression/` - Player power progression
- `/docs/specs/simplified-attributes/` - Simplified attributes system

### Option 2: Start the workflow properly
Run the complete workflow with a feature description:
```bash
/flow:prd <your-feature-description-here>
```

This will generate a proper PRD, then you can run `/flow:design` and `/flow:tasks` on it.

### Option 3: Tell me which feature to work on
If you'd like me to help you generate tasks for one of your existing features, just let me know which one and I can run:
```bash
/flow:tasks /docs/specs/[feature-name]/technical_design_*.md
```

Which option would you like to proceed with?
