I'll generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document based on the feature description provided. Let me first check what feature description was provided.

Looking at the input, I can see this is a slash command invocation but I don't see the feature description argument. Let me ask for clarification.

Could you please provide the feature description for which you'd like me to generate a PRD? You can either:

1. Provide the feature description as text directly (e.g., `/flow:prd Add user authentication with OAuth`)
2. Provide a path to a file containing the feature description (e.g., `/flow:prd docs/features/user-auth.md`)

Once you provide the feature description, I'll generate a comprehensive, lean PRD following the principles in the Lean Task Generation Guide that focuses on:
- User-visible functionality from the start
- Measurable success criteria
- Clear scope with MVP priorities
- Realistic timelines and dependencies
- Actionable requirements for implementation
