It looks like the `/flow:tasks` command hasn't been successfully run yet to generate the task list from the TDD. Based on your request and the command documentation, you want me to execute the `/flow:execute-task` command which should work with a tasks file.

However, I need to clarify the situation:

1. The `tdd_20251104.md` file appears to contain conversation transcripts, not an actual TDD document
2. There IS a proper TDD at `/mnt/c/dev/class-one-rapids/docs/specs/20251104_233945/technical_design_20251105.md`
3. There are NO tasks generated from this TDD yet

Would you like me to:

**Option A**: Generate tasks from the TDD first using the `/flow:tasks` workflow, then execute them  
**Option B**: Start implementing the features directly based on the TDD document without the tasks file

Which approach would you prefer?
