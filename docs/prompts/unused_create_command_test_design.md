  @docs/research/claude_code_commands_guide_20250916_060309.md and create a claude code command     
  that takes in a list of requirements generated by @.claude/commands/design.md and writes a test   
  for each requirement. These tests should be at the parent level, be implementation agnostic, and  
  test things how the user uses the screen according to the guide you read.
