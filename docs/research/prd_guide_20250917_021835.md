## Best Practices

### 2024-2025 Modern PRD Practices

#### 1. Evidence-Based Problem Statements
- Include both quantitative data and qualitative insights
- Cite specific user feedback, support tickets, or behavioral data
- Quantify the impact of not solving the problem

#### 2. Visual Communication
- Use diagrams, wireframes, and flowcharts liberally
- Create clear visual hierarchies in documentation
- Use solid lines for defined elements, dotted lines for evolving components

#### 3. Stakeholder Collaboration
- Involve engineers, designers, and other teams early in the process
- Get input on feasibility, constraints, and dependencies
- Use collaborative tools for real-time feedback and iteration

#### 4. Balance Direction with Creativity
- Provide enough guidance to prevent spinning wheels
- Leave room for team creativity and technical expertise
- Focus on the "what" and "why," not the "how"

#### 5. Maintain as Living Document
- Update continuously throughout the product lifecycle
- Version control and track changes with rationale
- Regular review and refinement based on new learnings

#### 6. Modern Tooling Integration
- Leverage AI for initial drafts and research synthesis
- Use integrated platforms (Notion, Confluence) for seamless workflow
- Enable real-time collaboration and commenting

### Writing Quality Guidelines

#### Clarity and Specificity
```
❌ BAD: "The product should be easy to use"
✅ GOOD: "New users should be able to complete their first task within 5 minutes without assistance"

❌ BAD: "Fast loading time"
✅ GOOD: "Pages load in under 2 seconds for 95% of users on 3G connections"
```

#### User-Focused Language
```
❌ BAD: "Implement OAuth integration"
✅ GOOD: "As a user, I want to sign in with my Google account so that I don't need to remember another password"
```

#### Measurable Requirements
```
❌ BAD: "Improve user engagement"
✅ GOOD: "Increase average session duration from 3 minutes to 5 minutes within 60 days"
```

### Collaboration Best Practices

#### Review Process
1. **Internal Review:** Team lead and key stakeholders
2. **Cross-Functional Review:** Engineering, Design, QA, Marketing
3. **Stakeholder Sign-off:** Business owners and decision makers
4. **Version Control:** Track changes and maintain history

#### Communication Strategy
- Share drafts early and often
- Use asynchronous communication for initial feedback
- Schedule focused sync meetings for complex discussions
- Document decisions and rationale

#### Feedback Integration
- Acknowledge all feedback received
- Explain decisions when suggestions aren't incorporated
- Update document based on valid concerns
- Maintain change log with rationale

## Common Anti-Patterns

### Critical Mistakes to Avoid

#### 1. Problem Definition Failures
```
❌ Jumping straight to solutions without exploring the opportunity
❌ Trying to solve everything instead of making hard choices about scope
❌ Lacking clear, evidence-based problem statements
❌ Ignoring user research and feedback
```

#### 2. Documentation Issues
```
❌ Being too vague ("easy to use," "fast loading")
❌ Including too much unnecessary detail
❌ Writing for compliance rather than utility
❌ Creating documents that no one reads or uses
```

#### 3. Process Problems
```
❌ Writing PRDs in isolation without stakeholder input
❌ Failing to get engineering feasibility review early
❌ Not involving design and UX teams in requirements definition
❌ Treating the PRD as a one-time deliverable rather than living document
```

#### 4. Success Measurement Gaps
```
❌ Not defining clear success metrics
❌ Ignoring non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
❌ Failing to establish release criteria
❌ Missing post-launch measurement and iteration plans
```

#### 5. User Focus Problems
```
❌ Focusing on internal business needs over user value
❌ Ignoring edge cases and error scenarios
❌ Writing from system perspective instead of user perspective
❌ Not validating assumptions with real users
```

#### 6. Scope and Priority Issues
```
❌ Including too many features without prioritization
❌ Not defining what's explicitly out of scope
❌ Failing to distinguish between MVP and future iterations
❌ Not considering technical debt and maintenance costs
```

### Red Flags in PRD Reviews

#### Language Red Flags
- Vague qualifiers: "easy," "fast," "user-friendly," "intuitive"
- Assumptions without evidence: "users want," "customers need"
- Technology-focused instead of outcome-focused requirements
- Missing success criteria or measurable outcomes

#### Structure Red Flags
- No clear problem statement or user value proposition
- Missing acceptance criteria for user stories
- No consideration of edge cases or error states
- Lack of prioritization or scope boundaries

#### Process Red Flags
- Written without stakeholder input or review
- No validation with actual users or customers
- Missing technical feasibility assessment
- No plan for measuring success post-launch
