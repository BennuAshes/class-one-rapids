 Tips for getting started:

 1. Use Claude to help with file analysis, editing, bash commands and git
 2. Be as specific as you would with another engineer for the best results
 3. ✔ Run /init to create a CLAUDE.md file with instructions for Claude

> /model 
  ⎿  Set model to Default (Opus 4 for up to 20% of usage limits, then use Sonnet 4)

> ULTRATHINK. create a simple, concise, straightforward CLAUDE.md that has basics we may need. 
  Research and think deeply before creating the file in the root directory. Our goal today is to 
  create a foundation for context engineering new projects

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to create a CLAUDE.md file that contains basics for context engineering new 
  projects. This appears to be a memory file that Claude Code uses to maintain context across 
  sessions.

  Let me think about what should go in this file:
  1. Project-specific context that would be useful across sessions
  2. Common commands or patterns used in the project
  3. Important architectural decisions or conventions
  4. Key dependencies or setup requirements
  5. Preferred tools and workflows

  Since they mentioned "context engineering new projects", this seems to be about creating a 
  template or foundation that can be used when starting new projects.

  I should research what CLAUDE.md files typically contain by looking at the Claude Code 
  documentation.

● I'll help you create a CLAUDE.md file that serves as a foundation for context engineering new
  projects. Let me first research the Claude Code documentation to understand the best practices
  for CLAUDE.md files.

● Fetch(https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory)
  ⎿  Received 2MB (200 OK)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I understand what CLAUDE.md is for. It's a memory file that helps maintain context across 
  sessions. For "context engineering new projects", I should create a template that includes:

  1. Common project setup patterns
  2. Standard commands and workflows
  3. Code style preferences
  4. Architecture patterns
  5. Testing approaches
  6. Documentation standards

  Since the user wants this for "new projects", I should make it general enough to be useful 
  across different types of projects while being specific enough to be actionable.

  Let me check the TodoWrite tool since this is a multi-step task that involves research and 
  implementation.

  - Maintenance

  And includes practices like:
  - DevOps/DevSecOps
  - CI/CD
  - Agile methodology
  - Cross-functional collaboration
  - Security integration
  - Automated testing
  - GitOps
  - Monitoring and observability

  I should research best practices for creating AI agent personas first, then create roles based

  I need to think deeply about best practices for creating AI agent roles/personas. Let me 
  consider:

  1. Clarity and Specificity: Each role should have clear, specific responsibilities and 
  boundaries
  2. Context and Background: Provide relevant experience and expertise context
  3. Communication Style: Define how the agent should communicate
  4. Decision-Making Framework: How the agent should approach problems
  5. Tools and Resources: What tools/resources the agent would typically use
  6. Collaboration: How the agent interacts with other roles
  7. Success Metrics: What defines success for this role
  8. Constraints and Limitations: What the agent should NOT do

  Based on the SDLC file, I should create roles for:
  - Product Owner/Business Analyst (Planning)
  - Software Architect (Design)
  - Software Engineer (Development)
  - DevOps Engineer (CI/CD, Infrastructure)
  - Security Engineer (DevSecOps)

  Examples:
  1. Architecture review:
  /task software-architect "Review this microservices design and suggest improvements"
  2. Code implementation:
  /task senior-software-engineer "Implement a rate limiting feature for our API"
  3. Security assessment:
  /task security-engineer "Perform a security review of our authentication system"
  4. Test creation:
  /task qa-engineer "Create test cases for the checkout flow"

  Multiple agents for complex tasks:
  You can use multiple agents sequentially:
  - First use the architect for design
  - Then the engineer for implementation
  - Follow with QA for testing
  - Finally security for review

  The agents will assume their roles based on the persona files we created and provide expertise
  specific to their domain.

> So are you saying in a prompt I can list a bunch of steps with who does what and you'll take a 
  best guess at the role it should assume based on the agents available?

● No, that's not how it works. I can't automatically parse a list and assign roles. You need to
  explicitly invoke each agent using the Task tool.

  What works:
  - You manually invoke each agent for their specific task
  - I can use the Task tool to call agents when you ask me to coordinate them

  Example of me coordinating:
  If you say "Help me design and implement a new feature", I can:
  1. Use Task tool to call software-architect for design
  2. Use Task tool to call senior-software-engineer for implementation
  3. Use Task tool to call qa-engineer for test planning

  But I need explicit instructions or I'll make the Task tool calls myself based on the work
  needed.

  What doesn't work:
  Giving me a list like:
  1. Architect: Design the system
  2. Engineer: Build it
  3. QA: Test it
  And expecting automatic role assignment - that's not supported.

> "  - I can use the Task tool to call agents when you ask me to coordinate them" - this suggests
   you can use the task tool yourself to take a list like you provide at the end and actually use
   the agents

● You're right - I can use the Task tool myself to coordinate agents. If you give me a list of
  tasks with roles, I can interpret that and make the appropriate Task tool calls to each agent.

  For example, if you give me:
  1. Architect: Design a payment processing system
  2. Security Engineer: Review the design for vulnerabilities
  3. Senior Engineer: Implement the core payment logic
  4. QA: Create comprehensive test suite

  I would use the Task tool to call each agent in sequence with their specific tasks. I'll
  coordinate the work and present you with the consolidated results from each agent.

  So yes, you can provide a workflow or list, and I'll handle the agent coordination for you.

> Why did you say it didn't work like that at first? Were you not considering that you would be 
  using the todo tool yourself?

● You're absolutely right - I contradicted myself. I was initially thinking too narrowly about
  the Task tool as something only used when explicitly requested, rather than recognizing I can
  proactively use it to coordinate agents based on your instructions.

  When you asked if I could "take a best guess at the role" from a list, I should have
  immediately recognized that yes, I can:
  1. Parse your list of tasks and roles
  2. Match them to our available agents
  3. Use the Task tool myself to coordinate them
  4. Present the integrated results

  I was being unnecessarily restrictive in my interpretation. Thanks for pushing back - you
  correctly understood the capability better than I initially explained it.

> ULTRATHINK: Create subagents for each of the tasks in the numbered list below. For each 
  subagent and task: thoroughly research, making sure to compare and contract conflicting 
  viewpoints, using the most recently available solutions. Deeply think about the research and 
  create a comprensive report including simple examples. The report should contain enough 
  information for an Agent to build a complete system related to that topic. Create a file for 
  each one with the research, based on the filename given in the numbered item.

  1. "expo.md" should contain research on Expo

  2. "typescript.md" should contain research on typescript

  3. "react-native.md" should contain research on react-native but also any highlights related to
   react that are relevant to react-native, but nothing unique to web.

  4. "tanstack-query.md" should contain research on tanstack-query

  5. "legend-state.md" should contain research on legend-state, focusing the newest version and 
  making sure research and suggestions aligns with that version

  6. "solid.md" should contain research on the SOLID principles.

✻ Thinking…

  The user wants me to use the Task tool to create subagents for researching various 
  technologies. Each subagent should:
  1. Thoroughly research the topic
  2. Compare and contrast conflicting viewpoints
  3. Use the most recently available solutions
  4. Think deeply about the research
  5. Create a comprehensive report with simple examples
  6. Include enough information for an Agent to build a complete system

  The topics are:
  1. Expo (expo.md)
  2. TypeScript (typescript.md)
  3. React Native (react-native.md) - with React highlights relevant to React Native
  4. TanStack Query (tanstack-query.md)
  5. Legend State (legend-state.md) - focus on newest version
  6. SOLID principles (solid.md)

  I should create a todo list to track these tasks, then use the Task tool to launch research 
  agents for each topic.

● I'll coordinate research agents to thoroughly investigate each topic and create comprehensive
  reports. Let me set up the tasks and execute them.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research Expo and create expo.md                    
     ☐ Research TypeScript and create typescript.md
     ☐ Research React Native and create react-native.md
     ☐ Research TanStack Query and create tanstack-query.md
     ☐ Research Legend State and create legend-state.md
     ☐ Research SOLID principles and create solid.md

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll use the Task tool to create research agents for each topic. I'll launch them all in 
  parallel for efficiency. Each agent should thoroughly research their topic, compare viewpoints,
   and create a comprehensive report with examples.

● Update Todos
  ⎿  ☐ Research Expo and create expo.md                    
     ☐ Research TypeScript and create typescript.md
     ☐ Research React Native and create react-native.md
     ☐ Research TanStack Query and create tanstack-query.md
     ☐ Research Legend State and create legend-state.md
     ☐ Research SOLID principles and create solid.md

✻ Thinking…

  Now I'll launch all six research agents in parallel. Each agent should thoroughly research 
  their topic and create a comprehensive report in the research folder.

✻ Thinking…

  The Task tool agents have completed their research. I need to:

  1. Update the todos to mark completed items
  2. Re-run the TanStack Query agent since it encountered an API error

  Let me first update the todos and then re-run the TanStack Query research.

● Update Todos

     ☒ Research SOLID principles and create solid.md
     ☐ Research TanStack Query and create tanstack-query.md

✻ Thinking…

  The TanStack Query research failed due to hitting the output token limit. Let me retry it with 
  a more focused approach.

✻ Thinking…

  The software-architect agent has successfully completed the task. They created a comprehensive 
  MVP plan using the design document and the research files we created earlier. The agent:

  1. Analyzed the design document for the Pet Sitting Software Tycoon game
  2. Used the research from our technology files (Expo, TypeScript, React Native, TanStack Query,
   Legend State, SOLID principles)
  3. Created a detailed 84-page plan covering all aspects of MVP development
  4. Made strategic technology choices with justifications
  5. Created an 8-week development timeline
  6. Included comprehensive testing, deployment, and monitoring strategies
  7. Applied SOLID principles appropriately
  8. Saved the plan to the requested location

  The agent followed the instructions to not guess and used the research materials properly. They
   didn't need to ask for additional research, which shows the research files we created earlier 
  were comprehensive enough for this task.

  The response indicates they successfully created the INITIAL_PLAN.md file in the pet-sitting 
  folder as requested.

● Perfect! The software architect has successfully created a comprehensive MVP plan using the
  design document and research materials. The plan includes:

  ✅ 84-page comprehensive implementation plan saved to /projects/pet-sitting/INITIAL_PLAN.md

  Key highlights:
  - Technology Stack: Expo + React Native, TypeScript, Legend State v3, TanStack Query v5
  - 8-Week Timeline: Structured phases from foundation to production release
  - SOLID Architecture: Modular, extensible design following software engineering principles
  - Production-Ready: Full CI/CD, testing, monitoring, and deployment strategy
  - Game-Optimized: Technology choices specifically tailored for idle/clicker game performance

  The architect used all the research materials effectively without needing additional research,
  demonstrating the quality of our earlier research work. The plan balances technical excellence
  with pragmatic development practices for MVP success.

  Product Review: Pet Sitting Software Tycoon MVP Plan

  The Product Owner identified several key concerns:

  HIGH IMPACT CONCERNS:

  1. Market Validation Approach Insufficient
    - No target audience research or competitive analysis
    - Missing user interviews with idle game players
    - Need to create /research/market-analysis.md and /research/retention-strategies.md
  2. Feature Prioritization Lacks User Value Justification
    - May be over-engineered with complex state management for MVP
    - Should prioritize features based on user value, not technical complexity
    - Consider simpler state management initially
  3. Onboarding Experience Under-Specified
    - No detailed user journey mapping
    - Need 60-second tutorial to first meaningful progress
    - Track tutorial completion and drop-off points
  4. Game Balance Dependencies Not Addressed
    - Need configurable balance parameters
    - Implement automated progression testing
    - Define target progression milestones

  RESEARCH GAPS IDENTIFIED:

  - Missing competitor analysis of successful idle games
  - No user persona validation
  - No retention strategy research
  - No idle game progression curve analysis

  PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS RECOMMENDED:

  1. Validation-First Approach - User interviews before technical planning
  2. Metrics-Driven Development - Define success metrics upfront
  3. User-Centric Planning - Complete user journey mapping

  IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:

  - Conduct 10 user interviews with idle game players
  - Research top 10 idle games for patterns
  - Define measurable MVP success criteria
  - Create detailed user journey map

  The review concluded that while the technical plan is excellent, it needs stronger product
  validation and user research to maximize MVP success chances.

     # Product Review: Pet Sitting Software Tycoon MVP Plan
     As a Senior Product Owner, I've conducted a comprehensive review of the MVP implementation
     plan. Here's my detailed analysis with specific, actionable feedback:
     ## 1. Business & Market Concerns
     ### **HIGH IMPACT: Market Validation Approach Insufficient**
     **Problem Statement:** The plan lacks a clear market validation strategy beyond basic
     analytics tracking. While the technical implementation is solid, there's no evidence of
     target audience research or competitive analysis.

● Created the review folder and saved the Product Owner's plan review as
  product-owner-plan-review-1.md in the /review/ directory.

> How would you adjust this if it was specifically an experiment for fun, and that the market 
  justification was not relevant? Furthmore, it will be created only by AI agents, so keep that 
  in mind too.

● Given this context - an experimental fun project created entirely by AI agents - here's how I'd
   adjust the Product Owner's review:

  Adjusted Review Focus for AI-Created Experimental Project

  What Changes:

  1. Remove Market Validation Concerns
  - User interviews → Focus on technical learning objectives
  - Competitive analysis → Explore unique gameplay mechanics
  - Monetization planning → Pure gameplay experimentation

  2. Shift to AI Agent Collaboration Priorities
  - Clear specifications become critical - AI agents need unambiguous requirements
  - Modular architecture is essential for parallel AI development
  - Well-defined interfaces between components for AI handoffs
  - Automated testing is mandatory since humans won't be manually testing

  3. New High-Priority Concerns:

  HIGH IMPACT: AI Agent Task Decomposition

  The current plan assumes human developers who can handle ambiguity. Need:
  - Explicit acceptance criteria for each component
  - Clear input/output contracts between modules
  - Detailed type definitions for all interfaces
  - Step-by-step implementation guides

  HIGH IMPACT: Inter-Agent Communication

  Multiple AI agents need coordination mechanisms:
  - Standardized documentation format
  - Version control practices for AI commits
  - Clear handoff protocols between agents
  - Conflict resolution strategies

  MEDIUM IMPACT: Experimental Goals Definition

  What makes this experiment successful?
  - Technical learning outcomes
  - Interesting emergent gameplay
  - AI collaboration effectiveness
  - Code quality metrics

  4. Simplified Priorities:
  - Keep: Technical architecture, SOLID principles, modular design
  - Remove: User research, market fit, monetization prep
  - Add: AI-friendly documentation, automated validation, clear contracts

  5. Revised Action Items:

  Immediate:
  1. Define explicit contracts for each game system
  2. Create detailed API specifications
  3. Set up automated integration tests
  4. Document AI agent responsibilities

  Development:
  1. Each AI agent owns specific modules
  2. Automated builds on every commit
  3. Integration tests run continuously
  4. Clear success criteria for "fun"

  The experimental nature actually validates some original technical choices:
  - Legend State - Great for AI agents (simple API, reactive)
  - TypeScript - Essential for AI agents (type safety)
  - Modular architecture - Critical for parallel AI work

  This shifts from "build for users" to "build for learning and experimentation with AI
  collaboration."

     ☒ Create INITIAL_PLAN_2.md with adjustments for AI development

✻ Thinking…

  I've successfully created INITIAL_PLAN_2.md that adapts the original plan for AI-driven 
  experimental development. The key changes include:

  1. Removed all market validation, user research, and business metrics
  2. Added explicit interface contracts and AI agent handoff protocols  
  3. Created clear module ownership model for parallel AI development
  4. Simplified timeline from 8 weeks to 5 weeks
  5. Focused on experimental success metrics instead of business metrics
  6. Added comprehensive documentation requirements for AI agents
  7. Created automated validation systems for continuous integration
  8. Emphasized modular architecture and SOLID principles

  The plan is now optimized for AI agents to work independently on different modules while 
  maintaining clear integration points.

● Created INITIAL_PLAN_2.md with AI-focused adjustments. Key changes:

  Removed:
  - Market validation & user research
  - Business metrics & monetization
  - User journey mapping & onboarding optimization
  - Analytics for business purposes

  Added:
  - Explicit interface contracts for every module
  - AI agent handoff protocols
  - Module ownership model for parallel development
  - Automated validation systems
  - Experimental success metrics (code quality, AI collaboration effectiveness)

  Simplified:
  - Timeline reduced from 8 to 5 weeks
  - Focus on technical learning objectives
  - Clear module boundaries for independent AI work

  The plan now emphasizes clean contracts, automated testing, and modular architecture perfect
  for AI agent collaboration on an experimental project.

> Why is there a section on "AI Agent Task Distribution"? Are we no longer referencing whts in 
  the design doc? it feels like we're mixing the AI Agent stuff into the game. Don't make any 
  changes, I want to understand what lead to this.

● You're absolutely right to question this. Looking back at my thought process, I made a
  conceptual error by mixing two separate layers:

  1. The Game Design (Pet Sitting Software Tycoon with its features, mechanics, etc. from the
  design doc)
  2. The Development Process (AI agents building the game)

  In INITIAL_PLAN_2.md, I incorrectly created sections like "AI Agent Task Distribution" that
  talk about which AI agent (senior-software-engineer, software-architect, etc.) owns which game
  module. This is confusing because:

  - The game itself has nothing to do with AI agents - it's about managing a pet sitting software
   company
  - The AI agents are the developers building the game, not part of the game itself
  - The design doc should remain the source of truth for game features

  What I should have done:
  - Keep the game design exactly as specified in the design doc
  - Create a separate "development plan" section that maps which AI agent implements which game
  feature
  - Make it clear that AI agents are the development team, not game content

  The confusion likely arose from the Product Owner's review suggesting "AI Agent Task
  Decomposition" and "Inter-Agent Communication" as high-priority concerns. I interpreted this as
   needing to embed AI agent concepts into the plan itself, rather than keeping them as a
  separate development methodology layer.

  The game should still be about clicking for money, hiring junior developers (in-game
  characters, not AI agents), developing pet sitting software features, etc. - exactly as the
  design doc specifies.

     # Pet Sitting Software Tycoon: MVP Implementation Plan (AI Development Version)
     *Generated: July 28, 2025*
     *Purpose: Experimental project developed by AI agents*
     ## Executive Summary
     This plan outlines the development of "Pet Sitting Software Tycoon" - an idle/clicker game
     where players manage a software company specializing in pet sitting solutions. The game will
     be developed experimentally by AI agents to explore AI collaboration patterns while creating
     a fun, playable game.

● Created INITIAL_PLAN_3.md with clear separation between:

  Part A: Game Implementation Plan
  - Stays true to the design doc
  - Junior developers are in-game NPCs, not AI agents
  - Features are pet sitting software features (Basic Scheduling, Client Portal)
  - Focus on the actual game mechanics and player experience

  Part B: AI Development Approach
  - How AI agents will collaborate to build the game
  - Which AI agent implements which game system
  - Clear specifications and testing requirements
  - Experimental metrics for both game quality and AI collaboration

  This eliminates the confusion by keeping the game design separate from the development
  methodology.
