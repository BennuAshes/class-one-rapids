# Creating a context engineering system from scratch
## Goal
- Consistently create features from start to finish with little to no guidance
- Research can be conducted by AI
- Research is used by the commands to generate artifacts needed for an agent to compler



## Challenges
- Research generated by default contains a lot of noise
- Must understand what "information" means and what different kinds can exist, and what is useful to LLMs, or what is useful under certain circumstances
    - Can we conditionally load data at more detailed levels depending on need?
