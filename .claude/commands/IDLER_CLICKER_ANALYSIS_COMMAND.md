# Idle/Clicker Game Fun Factor Analysis Command

## Command to Copy & Paste

```markdown
**ULTRATHINK** You are an expert in idle/clicker game design with deep knowledge of dopamine-driven game mechanics, player psychology, and what makes these games addictively fun.

Do research on best practices for idle/clicker games focusing on FUN, not monetization or metrics. Research what makes idle clicker games fun, satisfying, and creates dopamine mechanics.

Look deeply at the provided design document and/or codebase. Trace through all the paths and understand what the user can see and experience. Map the complete player journey from first launch through first hour of gameplay.

Think deeply about how this cross-references with idle/clicker game best practices. Consider the psychological aspects of:
- Instant gratification (rewards within 3 seconds)
- Continuous progress (numbers always going up)
- Exponential growth (small numbers becoming huge)
- Low-pressure engagement (success without stress)
- Multiple progression layers (several systems running simultaneously)
- Visual/audio feedback (satisfying clicks, pops, celebrations)
- Strategic depth despite simple mechanics

Analyze through these specific lenses:

1. **The Dopamine Loop**
   - How quickly does the first reward come? (Target: <3 seconds)
   - How many dopamine hits per minute? (Target: 5-10)
   - What creates the "just one more tap" feeling?
   - Where are the celebration moments?

2. **Number Scaling**
   - Do numbers grow exponentially or linearly?
   - How satisfying is the progression curve?
   - When do players see their first "big" number?
   - Is there a prestige/ascension system for huge multipliers?

3. **Core Game Loop Timing**
   - Primary loop: How long between taps/clicks? (Target: 1-5 seconds)
   - Secondary loop: How long for automated rewards? (Target: 10-30 seconds)
   - Meta loop: How long to major milestones? (Target: 5-30 minutes)

4. **Player Emotional Journey**
   Map what players FEEL at:
   - First 30 seconds (Should be: Curious → Engaged)
   - First 5 minutes (Should be: Excited → Want more)
   - First hour (Should be: Addicted → Planning builds)
   - Return after break (Should be: Rewarded → Re-engaged)

5. **Critical Fun Metrics**
   Compare against industry standards:
   - First reward timing (Standard: <3 sec)
   - Level 1→2 time (Standard: <30 sec)
   - Actions per minute (Standard: 20-60)
   - Offline progress efficiency (Standard: 50% of active)
   - Number scale after 1 hour (Standard: 100x starting values)

Create the following deliverables:

1. **FUN_FACTOR_ANALYSIS.md** containing:
   - Executive summary of fun gaps
   - Detailed comparison vs idle game best practices
   - User experience walkthrough with emotional mapping
   - Specific examples of what's working and what's not
   - Quantified gaps (X times too slow, Y% fewer rewards, etc.)

2. **REVISED_GAME_DESIGN.md** containing:
   - Redesigned core loop prioritizing dopamine delivery
   - Specific number changes (timers, rewards, scaling)
   - New mechanics to add (tap-to-attack, combos, cascades)
   - UI/UX changes to emphasize progress
   - Week-by-week implementation roadmap

3. **CONCISE_SUMMARY** containing:
   - The core problem in one sentence
   - Top 5 critical gaps vs idle game standards
   - Top 5 quick fixes that could be done today
   - Expected fun factor improvement (current X/10 → potential Y/10)

Focus on what makes players go "just one more minute" for hours. Consider what creates the feeling of "numbers go BRRRRR" that idle game players crave. Every second should deliver dopamine, every minute should bring surprises, and every session should end with "just one more."

Remember: Players don't want a deep RPG that happens to be idle. They want their numbers to explode while they tap. The depth can exist, but it must serve the core satisfaction loop of continuous, exponential progress.

Then show me a concise summary of your findings with specific, actionable recommendations prioritized by impact on fun.

   - Copy the entire command block above
   - Paste it into Claude

3. **Add Your Specific Context**
   After the command, add:
   ```markdown
   Here is my design document: [paste or reference document]
   
   [Optional] Here is the codebase location: [path]
   
   [Optional] Previous analysis to consider: [reference]
   ```

4. **Review the Output**
   Expect to receive:
   - Comprehensive fun factor analysis
   - Revised design prioritizing dopamine

## Why This Command Works

### Triggers Deep Analysis
- **"ULTRATHINK"** - Activates thorough thinking mode
- **"Think deeply"** - Ensures comprehensive analysis
- **"Cross-reference"** - Compares against standards
- **"Trace through all paths"** - Complete examination

- Emphasizes dopamine and satisfaction
- Uses emotional language (FEEL, satisfaction, excitement)
- Targets psychological triggers

### Provides Specific Metrics
- Clear timing targets (3 seconds, 30 seconds, etc.)
- Quantified standards (5-10 hits/minute)
- Industry benchmarks for comparison
- Gap measurements (X times too slow)

### Demands Actionable Output
- Specific deliverables requested
- Implementation roadmap required
- Quick fixes identified
- Priority by impact

### Uses Idle Game Vocabulary
