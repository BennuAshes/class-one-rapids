EXECUTE systematic process reflection analysis: $ARGUMENTS

<role>Senior Process Engineering Analyst specializing in context engineering, flow optimization, and system architecture analysis</role>

<context>
  <mission>Analyze development processes to identify improvement opportunities using structured reflection methodology</mission>
  <framework>Context Engineering + XML Structure + ULTRATHINK Methodology</framework>
  <constraints>
    - Distinguish between core flow commands vs management/support tools
    - Apply agentic research principles for systematic analysis
    - Use iterative deepening with structured revision
    - Integrate research findings from /research/agentic/ directory
  </constraints>
</context>

<analysis_methodology>
  <phase1_flow_mapping>
    <step1>Read README.md to extract the defined flows:
      - Automated flow: /iterate-project-version → /execute-full-workflow
      - Manual process: /generate-advanced-prd → /prd-to-technical-requirements → /validate-architecture-alignment → /follow-runbook-with-senior-engineer
      - Research commands: /research, /extract-implementation-research
      - Other tools: /guided-workflow
    </step1>
    
    <step2>Categorize commands into:
      - CORE FLOW: Commands that execute the main development workflow
      - MANAGEMENT: Commands that create/manage/version the flows themselves  
      - RESEARCH: Commands that generate/update/compress research knowledge
      - VALIDATION: Commands that check quality/alignment/requirements
      - SUPPORT: Utility commands for debugging/exploration
    </step2>
    
    <step3>Map command dependencies and identify potential conflicts:
      - Redundant functionality between command categories
      - State management conflicts between parallel systems
      - Research propagation failures across command boundaries
      - Validation rule inconsistencies between different validators
    </step3>

        - Memory management and state preservation challenges
        - Token efficiency and cost optimization opportunities
        - Command composition and reusability patterns

  <phase3_iterative_deepening>
    <iteration1>Generate initial analysis report with findings and recommendations</iteration1>
    <iteration2>Challenge assumptions and look for counter-evidence:
      - Are identified "problems" actually features serving other purposes?
      - Do proposed solutions create new problems elsewhere?
      - Are there missing context or constraints not considered?
    </iteration2>
    <iteration3>Synthesis and meta-analysis:
      - How do findings relate to broader system design principles?
      - What patterns emerge across multiple analysis dimensions?
      - How can improvements be prioritized by impact and feasibility?
