Remember any new files in the /wisdom/ folder. Make sure to only remember information directly contained in the files. Do not hallucinate. Do not make information up. Do not use your general knowledge. Only use the information contained within the wisdom files.

Once you've learned the files, move them to ./wisdom/learned/
