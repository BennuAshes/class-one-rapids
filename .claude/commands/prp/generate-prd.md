    <tool>Read: .claude/commands/prp/templates/prd-template.md</tool>
  </step>
  
  <step id="2">
    <action>Analyze the feature/bug description</action>
    <analysis>
      - Identify the core problem or opportunity
      - Determine affected user types
      - Extract key functionality needs
      - Note any mentioned constraints or edge cases
    </analysis>
  </step>
  
  <step id="3">

        - Clear problem statement
      </introduction>
      
      <requirements>

        - Each story follows: "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
        - 2-4 acceptance criteria per story
        - Use WHEN/THEN format for clarity
        - Include edge cases where relevant
      </requirements>
      
      <success_metrics>
        - 3-5 measurable outcomes

        - Related but separate features
      </out_of_scope>
    </content_generation>
  </step>
  
  <step id="4">
    <action>Create the final PRD document</action>
    <formatting>
      - Replace template placeholders with generated content
      - Ensure consistent formatting

## Execution

Analyze: $ARGUMENTS

1. **Load Template**: Read the PRD template from `.claude/commands/prp/templates/prd-template.md`

2. **Parse Input**: Extract key information from the feature/bug description:
   - What is being requested?
   - Who will use it?
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What are the constraints?

3. **Generate Content**:
   - Write a concise introduction (2-3 paragraphs max)
   - Create focused user stories with clear acceptance criteria
   - Define measurable success metrics
   - Identify what's explicitly out of scope

4. **Save PRD**: Create the document as `PRD-[feature-name].md` in the current directory or appropriate documentation folder

Focus on clarity and actionability. Every requirement should be testable and every user story should deliver clear value.
