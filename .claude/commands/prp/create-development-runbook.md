</context>

**PHASE 1: PRD ANALYSIS AND TECHNICAL REQUIREMENT EXTRACTION**
Systematically parse the technically detailed PRD:

1. **Read and analyze the PRD** to extract:
   - Business objectives and success metrics
   - Technical architecture and implementation requirements
   - Feature specifications with acceptance criteria
   - Technical constraints and dependencies
   - Performance and quality requirements
   - Integration points and external services
   - Security and compliance considerations

2. **Load task decomposition methodology** from research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md:
   - Apply cognitive psychology principles (Miller's 7±2 rule)
   - Use hierarchical structure patterns (Strategic → Tactical → Operational)
   - Implement progressive elaboration techniques
   - Apply atomic actionability validation
   - Use multi-perspective validation framework

## TASK ATOMICITY VALIDATION
Before creating any task descriptions:
- Apply "atomic actionability test" from research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md:132
- Each task MUST be fully implementable within the description, not just structural planning
- No task should reference creating empty directories without implementation content
- Validate that each task produces working, testable code

## RESEARCH COMPLIANCE VALIDATION
Before generating any architectural decisions, load and enforce research principles:
- Read ALL files in research/tech/ folder to understand current architectural best practices
- Read ALL files in research/planning/ folder to understand methodology requirements
- Apply learned research principles to validate all architectural decisions during generation
- Ensure generated architecture complies with established research patterns
- Block generation if research principle violations detected

3. **Extract implementation scope** from PRD:
   - Identify all features requiring development
   - Map technical requirements to implementation tasks
   - Understand cross-feature dependencies
   - Assess complexity levels and skill requirements
   - Document assumptions and constraints

**PHASE 2: STRATEGIC DECOMPOSITION**
Apply top-level hierarchical breakdown following cognitive optimization principles:

<strategic_breakdown>
STRATEGIC LEVEL DECOMPOSITION (3-5 major components):
- Follow cognitive limitation principles (max 7±2 components)
- Map PRD business objectives to development phases
- Identify major deliverables and milestones
- Establish clear hierarchical relationships
- Apply resource-rational framework optimization

CREATE STRATEGIC PHASES:
1. **Foundation Phase**: Core infrastructure and setup
2. **Core Feature Phase**: Primary functionality implementation
3. **Integration Phase**: External service and cross-feature integration
4. **Quality Phase**: Testing, optimization, and validation
5. **Deployment Phase**: Release preparation and deployment
</strategic_breakdown>

**PHASE 3: TACTICAL BREAKDOWN**
Decompose strategic phases into work packages optimized for junior developers:

<tactical_decomposition>
For each strategic phase, create TACTICAL WORK PACKAGES:
- Break deliverables into manageable work packages
- Apply "atomic actionability" test for junior developer capability
- Ensure each package is completable within 1-3 days
- Identify clear dependencies and critical path elements
- Assign single point of accountability per package
- Create specific, measurable acceptance criteria

TACTICAL VALIDATION:
- Can a junior developer complete this without further breakdown?
- Are dependencies minimal and clearly documented?
- Does this align with cognitive load limitations?
- Is the outcome measurable and verifiable?
</tactical_decomposition>

**PHASE 4: OPERATIONAL REFINEMENT**
Create detailed, junior developer-optimized task specifications:

<operational_tasks>
For each tactical work package, generate OPERATIONAL TASKS:
- Create step-by-step implementation instructions
- Include code examples and technical guidance
- Specify tools, libraries, and resources needed
- Provide clear success criteria and validation steps
- Include error handling and troubleshooting guidance
- Reference relevant documentation and learning resources

JUNIOR DEVELOPER OPTIMIZATION:
- Use clear, non-technical language where possible
- Provide context and rationale for each step
- Include learning resources and skill-building opportunities
- Anticipate common mistakes and provide guidance
- Create checkpoints for validation and feedback
</operational_tasks>

**PHASE 5: RUNBOOK GENERATION AND QUALITY VALIDATION**
Generate the comprehensive implementation runbook:

<runbook_structure>
# Implementation Runbook: [PRD Title]

## Executive Summary
- Project overview and objectives
- Technical architecture summary
- Timeline and milestone overview
- Resource and skill requirements

## Prerequisites and Setup
- Development environment requirements
- Tool and library installation instructions
- Initial project structure creation
- Validation checklist for environment readiness

## Strategic Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
[Hierarchical breakdown of foundation tasks]
- **Work Package 1.1**: [Specific package]
  - Task 1.1.1: [Atomic task with step-by-step instructions]
  - Task 1.1.2: [Atomic task with validation criteria]
  - [Continue with cognitive-optimized task organization]

### Phase 2: Core Features
[Detailed breakdown following same pattern]

### Phase 3: Integration
[Cross-feature and external service integration tasks]

### Phase 4: Quality Assurance
[Testing, optimization, and validation tasks]

### Phase 5: Deployment
[Release preparation and deployment tasks]

## Quality Validation Framework
- Technical validation checkpoints
- Stakeholder review requirements
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Performance and quality metrics

## Resources and Support
- Documentation references
- Learning resources for skill development
- Troubleshooting guides
- Support escalation procedures
</runbook_structure>

**MULTI-PERSPECTIVE VALIDATION**
Apply comprehensive quality validation:

<validation_framework>
TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE:
- Can tasks be executed with available resources and junior developer skills?
- Are technical specifications accurate and implementable?
- Do tasks follow PRD requirements exactly?

TEMPORAL PERSPECTIVE:
- Do dependencies and timelines align realistically?
- Are task estimates appropriate for junior developer skill level?
- Is the critical path clearly identified?

STAKEHOLDER PERSPECTIVE:
- Do outcomes meet PRD business requirements?
- Are acceptance criteria aligned with success metrics?
- Is progress visible and measurable?

RISK PERSPECTIVE:
- Are potential failure points identified?
- Are mitigation strategies provided?
- Is junior developer support adequate?
</validation_framework>

**COGNITIVE OPTIMIZATION PRINCIPLES**
Ensure runbook follows research-backed principles:

<cognitive_optimization>
HIERARCHICAL ORGANIZATION:
- Maximum 7±2 items at each hierarchical level
- Clear parent-child relationships
- Progressive detail revelation

ATOMIC ACTIONABILITY:
- Each task completable without further breakdown
- Single point of accountability
- Clear start and end conditions

JUNIOR DEVELOPER FOCUS:
- Appropriate skill level assumptions
- Learning and growth opportunities
- Clear escalation paths for complex issues
- Supportive guidance and context
</cognitive_optimization>

**DELIVERABLE**: Comprehensive implementation runbook featuring:
- **Exact PRD Compliance**: All requirements followed precisely as specified
- **Junior Developer Optimization**: Tasks appropriately sized and guided for skill level
- **Cognitive-Based Structure**: Hierarchical organization respecting human processing limitations
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Systematic breakdown from strategic to operational levels
- **Quality Validation**: Multi-perspective validation ensuring completeness and accuracy
- **Resource Integration**: Learning resources and support mechanisms embedded throughout
- **Actionable Tasks**: Every task is atomic, measurable, and executable
