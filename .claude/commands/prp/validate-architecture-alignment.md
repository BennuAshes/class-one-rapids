</context>

<memory_strategy>Maintain comprehensive validation checklist tracking each research principle against planned architecture, with clear pass/fail criteria for implementation gate approval</memory_strategy>

<parallel_execution>Optimize validation by concurrent verification of: directory structure patterns, state management design, component organization, and naming conventions against research standards</parallel_execution>

**PHASE 1: RUNBOOK ARCHITECTURE EXTRACTION**
Parse implementation runbook to extract planned architectural decisions:

1. **Read and analyze the runbook** to extract:
   - Planned directory structure and organization
   - State management architecture approach
   - Component organization patterns
   - Naming convention standards
   - Technology integration patterns
   - Feature boundary definitions

2. **Map runbook architecture** against intended patterns:
   - Identify vertical slicing application
   - Extract feature-based organization approach
   - Analyze component placement strategy
   - Review state management modularization

**PHASE 2: RESEARCH PRINCIPLE VALIDATION**
Validate planned architecture against established research foundations:

## VERTICAL SLICING COMPLIANCE CHECK
Load research/planning/vertical-slicing.md and validate:
- [ ] **Feature-Based Organization**: Each feature in own folder with complete functionality
- [ ] **High Cohesion Within Slices**: Related functionality grouped together
- [ ] **Low Coupling Between Slices**: Minimal dependencies between features
- [ ] **INVEST Criteria Application**: Features are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- [ ] **No Horizontal Layering**: Entities/utilities integrated within features, not separate layers

## REACT NATIVE STANDARDS COMPLIANCE CHECK
Load research/tech/react-native.md and validate:
- [ ] **Component Organization**: Follows established React Native project structure patterns
- [ ] **Custom Hooks Pattern**: Reusable logic implemented as hooks, not utility functions
- [ ] **Naming Conventions**: Consistent PascalCase for components, established patterns followed
- [ ] **Direct Import Patterns**: No unnecessary index.ts re-export files
- [ ] **Platform Standards**: Mobile-specific patterns, not web development translations

## LEGEND STATE ARCHITECTURE COMPLIANCE CHECK
Load research/tech/legend-state.md and validate:
- [ ] **Modular State Architecture**: Feature-specific observables, not monolithic state
- [ ] **State Co-location**: State managed within features where used
- [ ] **Observable Composition**: Higher-level state composed from feature-specific observables
- [ ] **Performance Patterns**: Proper fine-grained reactivity implementation

## TASK DECOMPOSITION COMPLIANCE CHECK
Load research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md and validate:
- [ ] **Atomic Actionability**: Each task fully implementable as described
- [ ] **Cognitive Load Management**: Directory structure respects Miller's 7Â±2 rule
- [ ] **Progressive Elaboration**: Detailed tasks for near-term work, high-level for future
- [ ] **No Empty Structures**: All planned directories have implementation content

**PHASE 3: VALIDATION GATE DECISION**
Apply strict validation criteria to determine implementation approval:

<validation_gate>
IMPLEMENTATION GATE CRITERIA:

**PASS CONDITIONS (All must be true):**
- Vertical slicing compliance: 100% (all checklist items pass)
- React Native standards compliance: 100% (all checklist items pass)
- Legend State architecture compliance: 100% (all checklist items pass)
- Task decomposition compliance: 100% (all checklist items pass)
- No forbidden architectural patterns detected
- All planned features have complete implementation tasks

**FAIL CONDITIONS (Any triggers implementation block):**
- Any research compliance check fails
- Horizontal layering patterns detected (src/entities/, src/utils/ outside features)
- Monolithic state architecture planned
- Empty directory creation without implementation content
- Non-React Native patterns (index.ts files, utility functions instead of hooks)
- Inconsistent naming conventions

**VALIDATION ACTIONS:**
- **PASS**: Generate approval with research principle confirmation
- **FAIL**: Block implementation with specific violation details and remediation guidance
</validation_gate>

**PHASE 4: VIOLATION REPORTING AND REMEDIATION GUIDANCE**
When validation fails, provide specific guidance for runbook correction:

<remediation_guidance>
VIOLATION REMEDIATION FRAMEWORK:

**Vertical Slicing Violations:**
- Move entities/utilities into feature directories
- Reorganize components by feature ownership
- Eliminate horizontal layers in favor of vertical slices
- Apply INVEST criteria to feature boundaries

**React Native Standards Violations:**
- Replace utility functions with custom hooks
- Remove index.ts re-export files
- Standardize component naming conventions
- Apply mobile-specific architectural patterns

**Legend State Architecture Violations:**
- Break monolithic state into feature-specific observables
- Co-locate state with features that manage it
- Implement proper observable composition patterns
- Apply fine-grained reactivity principles

**Task Decomposition Violations:**
- Apply atomic actionability test to all tasks
- Ensure all directories have implementation content
- Reduce cognitive complexity in directory structure
- Add implementation details to incomplete tasks
</remediation_guidance>

**PHASE 5: VALIDATION REPORT GENERATION**
Generate comprehensive validation report:
