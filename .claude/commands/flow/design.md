# Technical Design Document Generator

## Input Processing & Validation

**IMPORTANT**: Due to slash command argument handling, this command receives the PRD file path through **stdin** (piped input), similar to `/flow:prd`.

The workflow script will pipe the PRD file path as: `echo "$PRD_FILE_PATH" | claude /flow:design`

### Step 1: Extract PRD File Path from Input

The PRD file path will be provided as the first line of stdin input.

**Process**:

1. Read the input to get the PRD file path
2. Validate the file path is not empty
3. Check if file exists
4. Load PRD contents using Read tool

## 📚 MANDATORY ARCHITECTURE GUIDES

**Consult these guides while creating the Technical Design Document**:

1. **Lean Development Principles**: @docs/architecture/lean-task-generation-guide.md

   - Focus on user-visible features in implementation plan
   - Just-in-time infrastructure approach
   - Avoid over-engineering

2. **File Organization**: @docs/architecture/file-organization-patterns.md

   - Component structure and module organization
   - Co-located tests (NO `__tests__` folders)
   - NO barrel exports (index.ts files)

3. **Working Directory Context**: @docs/architecture/working-directory-context.md

   - Understand project structure and paths
   - Directory organization conventions

4. **State Management**: @docs/architecture/state-management-hooks-guide.md

   - Hook-based architecture patterns
   - **Behavior-Based Hook Naming**: See §🧭 Hook Decision Tree & Behavior-Based Naming
   - **When to use useState vs custom hooks vs Legend-State stores**
   - **Hook naming focuses on BEHAVIOR not entity**: `usePersistedCounter` not `usePet`
   - Fine-grained reactivity patterns
   - **Effect hooks**: See §🔄 Advanced Hook Patterns - Effect Hooks Pattern (lines 759-830)

5. **Legend-State Implementation**: @docs/research/expo_legend_state_v3_guide_20250917_225656.md

   - Legend-State v3 patterns for data model design
   - Observable primitives and persistence

6. **React Native Testing**: @docs/research/react_native_testing_library_guide_20250918_184418.md
   - Testing best practices for TDD strategy
   - Query priorities and async handling

---

**Error Handling**:

- If no path provided in stdin:

  - STOP execution immediately
  - Output: "ERROR: PRD file path required. Usage: echo '/path/to/prd.md' | claude /flow:design"
  - DO NOT create any output files
  - EXIT

- If file does not exist:

  - STOP execution immediately
  - Output: "ERROR: PRD file not found at: {path}"
  - DO NOT create any output files
  - EXIT

- If file is empty or invalid:
  - STOP execution immediately
  - Output: "ERROR: PRD file is empty or invalid"
  - DO NOT create any output files
  - EXIT

### Step 2: Load and Validate PRD Contents

ONLY proceed if validation passes:

1. Use Read tool to load PRD file contents
2. Verify PRD contains required sections (Problem Statement, Requirements, etc.)
3. Extract key information for TDD generation

**CRITICAL**: Never save error messages as TDD output. If ANY step fails, report the error clearly and exit without creating files.

Generate a comprehensive Technical Design Document based on the PRD.

## Phase 1: PRD Analysis

Analyze the PRD to extract:

1. **Core Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements
2. **User Stories**: Understanding the user flows and acceptance criteria
3. **Success Metrics**: Performance targets and KPIs
4. **Scope Definition**: MVP features vs future enhancements
5. **Dependencies & Risks**: Technical constraints and mitigation needs

## Phase 2: Technical Solution Design

Based on the PRD analysis, design the technical solution covering:

### Architecture Decisions

- Choose appropriate architectural patterns (monolithic, microservices, serverless)
- Define system boundaries and component responsibilities
- Select technology stack based on requirements
- Design for scalability, reliability, and maintainability

### Implementation Strategy

- Break down features into technical components
- Define interfaces and contracts between components
- Plan data flow and state management
- Design error handling and recovery mechanisms

## Phase 3: TDD Generation

Generate a comprehensive Technical Design Document with these sections:

### Document Structure

## 7. Test-Driven Development (TDD) Strategy
### TDD Approach (MANDATORY)
**All implementation must follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle**

#### Testing Framework & Tools
- Framework: React Native Testing Library
- Reference: @docs/research/react_native_testing_library_guide_20250918_184418.md
- Test Runner: Jest with React Native preset
- Mocking: MSW for API mocking, Jest mocks for modules

#### TDD Implementation Process
For each feature/component, follow this strict order:

1. **RED Phase - Write Failing Test First**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Test for a new feature requirement
   test('should display user name in header', () => {
     render(<Header user={mockUser} />);
     expect(screen.getByText('John Doe')).toBeTruthy();
   });
   // This test MUST fail initially
````

2. **GREEN Phase - Minimal Implementation**

   - Write ONLY enough code to pass the test
   - No extra features or optimizations
   - Focus on making test green

3. **REFACTOR Phase - Improve Code**
   - Clean up implementation
   - Extract components/functions
   - Maintain all green tests

#### Test Categories (in order of implementation)

### Unit Testing (TDD First Layer)

- **Render Tests**: Component displays correctly
- **Interaction Tests**: User actions work properly
- **State Tests**: Data changes trigger correct updates
- Coverage target: > 80% for new code
- Testing approach: Test behavior, not implementation

### Integration Testing (TDD Second Layer)

- **Component Integration**: Parent-child data flow
- **API Integration**: MSW mock handlers
- **Navigation Testing**: Screen transitions
- **Context/State Management**: Global state updates

### End-to-End Testing (TDD Third Layer)

- **User Flows**: Complete feature workflows
- **Cross-Feature Integration**: Feature interactions
- **Performance Benchmarks**: Response time requirements

### TDD Checklist for Each Component

- [ ] First test written before any implementation code
- [ ] Each test covers one specific behavior
- [ ] Tests use React Native Testing Library patterns
- [ ] No testIds unless absolutely necessary
- [ ] Tests query by user-visible content
- [ ] Async operations use waitFor/findBy
- [ ] All tests pass before next feature

_Generated from PRD: [filename]_
_Generation Date: [timestamp]_

```

## Generation Requirements

The TDD must:
1. **Directly address all PRD requirements** with technical solutions
2. **Include specific technologies** not vague descriptions
3. **Define measurable performance criteria** aligned with PRD metrics
4. **Provide implementation-ready details** for developers
5. **Include realistic timelines** based on technical complexity
6. **Address all risks** from PRD plus new technical risks
7. **Follow best practices** from the research guide

## Quality Markers

✅ **GOOD**: "Use PostgreSQL 14+ with JSONB columns for flexible schema, indexed on user_id and created_at"
❌ **BAD**: "Use a database for data storage"

✅ **GOOD**: "Implement JWT tokens with 15-minute expiry, refresh tokens in Redis with 7-day TTL"
❌ **BAD**: "Implement secure authentication"

✅ **GOOD**: "Deploy using Kubernetes with 3 replicas, HPA scaling 2-10 pods based on 70% CPU"
❌ **BAD**: "Ensure the system is scalable"

## Implementation Steps

1. **Read the PRD** at the specified path
2. **Extract key information** including requirements, user stories, metrics, and scope
3. **Design technical solution** addressing each PRD requirement
4. **Generate comprehensive TDD** following the template
5. **Include realistic details** for immediate implementation
6. **Save the document** with proper naming and location

## Output

Save the generated TDD to:
- Filename: `tdd_[feature_name_snake_case]_[YYYYMMDD].md`
- Location: Same directory as the source PRD file
- Include generation timestamp and source PRD reference

The TDD should enable the development team to immediately begin implementation with clear technical direction and architectural decisions already made.
