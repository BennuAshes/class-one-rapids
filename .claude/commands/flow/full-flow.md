**YOU MUST NOW EXECUTE THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW** from feature description to working code.

**FIRST: USE TodoWrite tool** to create these 4 workflow steps as todos:
1. Generate PRD document
2. Generate Technical Design Document
3. Generate Task List
4. Execute all tasks (generate code)

**THEN: Execute each step using Task tool with general-purpose subagent**. After each step completes:
- **USE TodoWrite** to mark that step "completed"
- **USE TodoWrite** to mark the next step "in_progress"
- Check the file path generated by the previous step
- Pass that file path to the next agent

**Workflow Steps:**

1. **Task tool with general-purpose agent** to generate PRD
   - Prompt: "Generate a comprehensive Product Requirements Document from the feature description at [path to file: $ARGUMENTS]. Follow the /flow:prd command pattern. Save the PRD to specs/prd_*.md"
   - Generates PRD document at `specs/prd_*.md`

2. **Task tool with general-purpose agent** to generate Technical Design
   - Prompt: "Generate a comprehensive Technical Design Document from the PRD at [path to PRD file generated by step 1]. Follow the /flow:design command pattern. Save the TDD to specs/tdd_*.md"
   - Generates TDD document at `specs/tdd_*.md`

3. **Task tool with general-purpose agent** to generate Task List
   - Prompt: "Generate an explicit, agent-executable task list from the Technical Design Document at [path to TDD file generated by step 2]. Follow the /flow:tasks command pattern. Save the task list to specs/tasks_*.md"
   - Generates task list at `specs/tasks_*.md`

4. **Task tool with general-purpose agent** to execute tasks
   - Prompt: "Execute all tasks from the task list at [path to task list file generated by step 3] using Test-Driven Development methodology. Follow the /flow:execute-task command pattern. Generate actual code files (tests and implementation)."
   - **This step generates actual code** - tests and implementation files
   - DO NOT STOP until this completes with working code

**CRITICAL**: Step 4 must result in actual code files being created, not just reading the task list.
