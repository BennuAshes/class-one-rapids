**YOU MUST NOW EXECUTE THE COMPLETE WORKFLOW** from feature description to working code.

**FIRST: USE TodoWrite tool** to create these 4 workflow steps as todos:
1. Generate PRD document
2. Generate Technical Design Document
3. Generate Task List
4. Execute all tasks (generate code)

**THEN: Execute each step using SlashCommand tool**. After each step completes:
- **USE TodoWrite** to mark that step "completed"
- **USE TodoWrite** to mark the next step "in_progress"
- Check the file path generated by the previous step
- Pass that file path to the next command

**Workflow Steps:**

1. `/flow:prd` [path to file: $ARGUMENTS]
   - Generates PRD document at `specs/prd_*.md`

2. `/flow:design` [path to PRD file generated by step 1]
   - Generates TDD document at `specs/tdd_*.md`

3. `/flow:tasks` [path to TDD file generated by step 2]
   - Generates task list at `specs/tasks_*.md`

4. `/flow:execute-task` [path to task list file generated by step 3]
   - **This step generates actual code** - tests and implementation files
   - DO NOT STOP until this completes with working code

**CRITICAL**: Step 4 must result in actual code files being created, not just reading the task list.
