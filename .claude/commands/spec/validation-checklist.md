- [ ] Each requirement has a user story
- [ ] User stories follow format: "As a [user], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
- [ ] Acceptance criteria use WHEN/THEN/IF structure
- [ ] Success metrics are specific and measurable
- [ ] Out of scope section defines boundaries

### Content Quality
- [ ] Focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- [ ] No technical implementation details
- [ ] Language is user-centric and business-focused
- [ ] All user scenarios are covered
- [ ] Edge cases are addressed in acceptance criteria

## Design Phase Validation

### Structure

## Tasks Phase Validation

### Structure
