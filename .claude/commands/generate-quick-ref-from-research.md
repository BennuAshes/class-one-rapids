    <guidelines>
      - Follow research from /research/agentic/llm-optimized-research-architecture.md
      - Apply compression strategies from /research/agentic/compression-strategy-analysis.md
      - Use Pattern Language format from /research/agentic/pattern-template-formal-terminology.md
      - Implement hierarchical loading as documented

    <pattern_extraction>
      For each architectural pattern found, extract:
      - Pattern name (the term)
      - Intent (why use it)
      - Implementation (how - with concrete examples)
      - Anti-pattern (what NOT to do - with examples)
      
      Example:
      ```
      | Pattern | Intent | Implementation | Anti-Pattern |
      |---------|--------|----------------|--------------|
      | vertical-slicing | Independent features | features/{name}/state/store.ts | NOT: core/state/gameStore.ts |
      ```
    </pattern_extraction>
    
    <package_documentation>
      For each critical package, include:
      - Package name with EXACT version
      - Key benefit (why use it)
      - Critical gotcha (what to watch for)
      
      Example:
      ```
      | Package | Version | Benefit | Watch Out |
      |---------|---------|---------|-----------|
      | @legendapp/state | @beta | 40% perf boost | Metro config needed |
      ```
    </package_documentation>
    
    <hierarchical_structure>
      L1: Critical (50-100 tokens) - ALWAYS loaded
      - Top 5 packages with versions
      - Top 5 patterns with implementation hints
      - Critical anti-patterns
      
      L2: Implementation (200-500 tokens) - Loaded for development
      - Full pattern descriptions with examples
      - Package configuration snippets
      - Common fixes and solutions
      
      L3: Reference (links only) - For deep dives
      - Links to source research files with line numbers
      - Full examples in research docs
    </hierarchical_structure>
  </requirements>
  
  <output_format>
    <structure>
      ```markdown
      # Quick-Ref (Context-Engineered)
      *Generated: [date]*
      *Method: LLM synthesis with semantic preservation*
      
      ## L1: CRITICAL (Always Load) ~[token count]
      
      ### Essential Packages
      [markdown table with package, version, benefit, gotcha]
      
      ### Core Patterns
      [markdown table with pattern, intent, implementation, anti-pattern]
      
      ## L2: IMPLEMENTATION (Development) ~[token count]
      
      ### Pattern Details
      [Expanded pattern descriptions with code examples]
      
      ### Configuration Examples
      [Key configs extracted from research]
      
      ## L3: REFERENCE (Deep Dive)
      
      ### Source Documents
      [Links to research files with specific line numbers]
      ```
    </structure>
    
    <quality_checks>
      - Each pattern MUST have implementation details (not just the name)
      - Anti-patterns MUST have concrete examples
      - Package versions MUST be exact (including @beta tags)
      - Token counts MUST be included for each section
      - Examples MUST show both correct and incorrect approaches
    </quality_checks>
  </output_format>
  
  <validation>
    After generating, verify:
    1. Would a developer reading ONLY L1 understand the core architecture?
    2. Does each pattern have enough context to prevent misimplementation?
    3. Are anti-patterns clear enough to avoid mistakes like centralized gameStore?
    4. Is the total L1 section under 200 tokens?
    5. Does L2 provide enough detail for implementation without reading full research?
  </validation>
</command>

## Instructions

Read all research files in `/research/` (except `/research/agentic/` which contains meta-research about this process) and synthesize an optimized quick-ref.md following the context engineering best practices documented in the agentic research itself.

The key innovation: Extract patterns with their FULL CONTEXT (intent, implementation, anti-pattern) not just their names. This prevents the "vertical slicing â†’ gameStore.ts" mistake.

Use markdown tables for maximum token efficiency and organize content hierarchically for progressive loading.

The output file should be saved to: ${1:-/research/quick-ref.md}
