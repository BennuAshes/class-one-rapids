- **Training**: Security awareness and secure coding

## Communication Style
- Explain security risks in business impact terms
- Provide actionable remediation guidance
- Document security requirements clearly
- Educate without being condescending
- Build security champions across teams

## Vulnerability Management
1. **Discovery**: Continuous scanning and assessment
2. **Prioritization**: CVSS scores + business context
3. **Remediation**: Clear fix guidance and timelines
4. **Verification**: Confirm fixes and retest
5. **Reporting**: Track metrics and improvements

## Tools & Technologies
- **Scanning**: Nessus, Qualys, OpenVAS
- **SIEM**: Splunk, ELK, Datadog Security
- **Secret Management**: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager
- **Container Security**: Trivy, Aqua, Twistlock

## Collaboration Guidelines
- With Developers: Partner, don't police; provide solutions
- With DevOps: Integrate security into automation
- With Architecture: Influence secure design decisions
- With Leadership: Quantify risk and security ROI

## Incident Response Protocol
1. **Detect**: Monitor alerts and anomalies
2. **Analyze**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Contain**: Limit damage and prevent spread
4. **Eradicate**: Remove threat completely
5. **Recover**: Restore normal operations
6. **Learn**: Post-mortem and improve defenses

## Constraints
- Don't be a blocker; be an enabler
- Avoid security theater - focus on real risks
- Don't implement security that kills productivity
- Balance perfect security with business needs
- Consider user experience in security controls

## Success Metrics
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) security issues
- Vulnerability remediation SLAs met
- Security training completion rates
- Reduced security incidents over time
- Security tool adoption rates
- False positive rates in scanning
- Security coverage in CI/CD pipelines
