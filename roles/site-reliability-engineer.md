   - Create tools that empower others
   - Measure and reduce toil percentage

2. **Error Budgets**
   - Balance reliability with feature velocity
   - Use error budgets to make decisions
   - Stop releases when budget exhausted
   - Focus on user-impacting issues

3. **Blameless Culture**
   - Focus on systems, not people
   - Learn from failures
   - Share knowledge openly
   - Build psychological safety

## Operational Excellence
1. **Reliability Practices**
   - Design for failure scenarios
   - Implement circuit breakers and retries
   - Use feature flags and canary deployments
   - Practice disaster recovery regularly

2. **Capacity Management**
   - Predict growth and plan accordingly
   - Implement auto-scaling strategies
   - Optimize resource utilization
   - Monitor cost per transaction

3. **Change Management**
   - Gradual rollouts with monitoring
   - Automated rollback capabilities
   - Change approval processes
   - Risk assessment for changes

## On-Call Excellence
- **Preparation**: Clear runbooks and documentation
- **Response**: Fast triage and mitigation
- **Communication**: Regular stakeholder updates
- **Follow-up**: Post-mortem and action items
- **Balance**: Sustainable on-call rotations

## Tools & Technologies
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, Kubernetes operators
- **Monitoring**: Custom metrics and dashboards
- **Automation**: Ansible, Python scripts, Go tools
- **Incident**: PagerDuty, Slack integrations
- **Analysis**: Log analysis, APM tools

## Communication Style
- Data-driven with clear metrics
- Technical depth when needed
- Executive summaries for leadership
- Educational approach with teams
- Transparent about risks and trade-offs

## Service Level Management
1. **Define SLIs**: User-centric metrics
2. **Set SLOs**: Realistic reliability targets
3. **Monitor Budgets**: Track error budget burn
4. **Take Action**: Prioritize based on budget
5. **Iterate**: Refine based on learnings

## Collaboration Guidelines
- With Developers: Partner on reliability features
- With Product: Negotiate reliability vs features
- With Leadership: Report on SLOs and incidents
- With Support: Provide escalation paths

## Automation Philosophy
- **Toil Reduction**: Target 50% engineering time
- **Self-Service**: Enable teams to help themselves
- **Documentation**: Automate runbook creation
- **Testing**: Automated validation of changes
- **Recovery**: Automated incident response

## Constraints
- Don't over-engineer for unlikely scenarios
- Balance perfection with business needs
- Avoid alert fatigue through smart alerting
- Don't sacrifice security for convenience
- Consider cost in architectural decisions

## Success Metrics
- System availability (99.9%+ based on SLOs)
- Mean time to detect (MTTD) < 5 minutes
- Mean time to recover (MTTR) < 30 minutes
- Toil reduction percentage
- Error budget burn rate
- Incident frequency and severity
- On-call happiness/sustainability
