# Technical Specification: Expo App Foundation

## Quick Summary
Build a production-ready Expo React Native application foundation with TypeScript, navigation, state management, and development tooling that runs on iOS, Android, and web platforms.

## Implementation Tasks

### Requirement: Cross-Platform Application Setup
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured Expo application with TypeScript support, so that I can build type-safe features across iOS, Android, and web platforms.

**Technical Tasks:**
1. [ ] Setup: Initialize Expo app with TypeScript template using `npx create-expo-app --template`
2. [ ] Config: Configure tsconfig.json with strict mode and path aliases
3. [ ] Platform: Verify app runs on iOS Simulator with `npx expo start --ios`
4. [ ] Platform: Verify app runs on Android Emulator with `npx expo start --android`
5. [ ] Platform: Verify app runs on web browser with `npx expo start --web`
6. [ ] Testing: Create smoke test to verify TypeScript compilation

**Acceptance Tests:**
- Test: App launches successfully on all three platforms without errors
- Test: TypeScript files compile without type errors when running `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Test: Platform-specific code can be conditionally executed using Platform.OS

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- Tests passing (build verification)
- README documented with setup instructions
- All platforms verified working

### Requirement: Navigation Infrastructure
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a navigation system with tab and stack navigation, so that I can easily add new screens and maintain consistent navigation patterns.

**Technical Tasks:**
1. [ ] Setup: Install expo-router with `npx expo install expo-router`
2. [ ] Structure: Create app directory with (tabs) layout for tab navigation
3. [ ] Frontend: Implement tab bar with Home, Profile, and Settings tabs
4. [ ] Frontend: Create stack navigation within each tab for nested screens
5. [ ] Config: Configure deep linking in app.config.js
6. [ ] Testing: Create navigation flow tests for tab switching

**Acceptance Tests:**
- Test: Tab bar displays with 3+ functional tabs on app launch
- Test: Navigation between tabs preserves screen state
- Test: Stack navigation within tabs allows push/pop operations
- Test: Deep links resolve to correct screens when app is opened

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- Navigation flows tested manually
- TypeScript types for navigation params defined
- Example screens created for each tab

### Requirement: State Management Foundation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a configured state management solution, so that I can manage application state efficiently and predictably.

**Technical Tasks:**
1. [ ] Setup: Install @legendapp/state with `npm install @legendapp/state`
2. [ ] Backend: Create state management structure following Feature State pattern
3. [ ] Frontend: Implement observable state for app-wide settings
4. [ ] Frontend: Create computed values for derived state
5. [ ] Integration: Setup persistence for critical state using AsyncStorage
6. [ ] Testing: Create unit tests for state updates and computed values

**Acceptance Tests:**
- Test: State updates trigger component re-renders automatically
- Test: Persisted state survives app restart
- Test: Multiple components can access and update shared state
- Test: Computed values update when dependencies change

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- State management patterns documented
- Unit tests passing with 80% coverage
- Example feature state implemented

### Requirement: Development Environment
**User Story:** As a developer, I want configured linting, formatting, and testing tools, so that I can maintain code quality and catch issues early.

**Technical Tasks:**
1. [ ] Setup: Configure ESLint with React Native and TypeScript rules
2. [ ] Setup: Configure Prettier with .prettierrc for code formatting
3. [ ] Setup: Install and configure Jest with React Native Testing Library
4. [ ] Integration: Setup husky for pre-commit hooks
5. [ ] Scripts: Add npm scripts for lint, format, and test commands
6. [ ] Testing: Create example unit and component tests

**Acceptance Tests:**
- Test: `npm run lint` identifies code style violations
- Test: `npm run format` automatically formats all code files
- Test: `npm run test` executes Jest tests with coverage report
- Test: Git commits are blocked if linting fails

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- All tools configured and working
- Example tests demonstrating patterns
- Scripts documented in package.json

### Requirement: Component Library Foundation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a basic set of reusable UI components, so that I can build consistent interfaces quickly.

**Technical Tasks:**
1. [ ] Frontend: Create Button component with primary/secondary/disabled variants
2. [ ] Frontend: Create TextInput component with validation and error states
3. [ ] Frontend: Create Card component for content containers
4. [ ] Frontend: Implement theme provider for light/dark mode support
5. [ ] Frontend: Create loading and error state components
6. [ ] Testing: Write component tests for all UI components

**Acceptance Tests:**
- Test: Button component renders all variants correctly
- Test: TextInput displays validation errors appropriately
- Test: Theme changes apply to all components instantly
- Test: Components accept and apply custom styles

**Definition of Done:**
- Code complete and reviewed
- Component stories/examples created
- All components have TypeScript props interfaces
- Theme switching works across all components

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React Native + Expo SDK 51
- Language: TypeScript 5.x
- Navigation: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- State: @legendapp/state (observable state management)
- Testing: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Styling: React Native StyleSheet
- Platform: iOS 13+, Android 5+, Modern web browsers
