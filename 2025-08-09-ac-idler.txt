> Use the research in the folder /research/game-design plus any further research on the web thats necessary then 
  ULTRATHINK and think longer and think harder to create a design document for an idler/clicker POC based on the 
  1999 MMORPG "Asheron's Call".

✻ Thinking…

  The user is asking me to create a design document for an idler/clicker POC based on the 1999 MMORPG "Asheron's 
  Call". They want me to:

  1. Use research in the folder /research/game-design
  2. Do further research on the web if necessary 
  3. "ULTRATHINK" and think longer/harder
  4. Create a design document

  This is a complex task that will involve multiple steps:
  1. Research the existing game design materials
  2. Research Asheron's Call (1999 MMORPG) 
  3. Think deeply about how to adapt it to an idler/clicker POC
  4. Create a design document

  This seems like a good candidate for the TodoWrite tool since it's a multi-step complex task. Let me start by 
  setting up a todo list and then begin researching.

  First, let me check what's in the /research/game-design folder.

● I'll research the game design materials and Asheron's Call to create a comprehensive idler/clicker POC design
  document. Let me start by setting up a todo list and examining the existing research.

● Update Todos

  Excellent! Now I have completed the comprehensive research document on idler/clicker games. Let me update my todo
   and move on to designing the core progression systems adapted from Asheron's Call to idler format.

     ☐ Create comprehensive Asheron's Call idler POC design document

✻ Thinking…

  Now I need to ULTRATHINK about how to adapt Asheron's Call's systems into an idler/clicker format. Let me think 
  deeply about this:

  Asheron's Call Key Systems to Adapt:

  1. Skill-based Progression: No classes, skill points can be allocated freely
  2. Six Core Attributes: Strength, Coordination, Quickness, Endurance, Focus, Self
  3. Flexible Character Building: 270 attribute points, 50 initial skill points
  4. Experience Point Investment: XP can be spent on skills/attributes
  5. Magic System: Extensive spell system with 1-7 power levels
  6. Tinkering/Crafting: Improving equipment with special effects
  7. Seamless World: Single persistent world
  8. Monthly Content Updates: Ongoing storyline and new content
  9. Dodge-based Combat: Skill-based spell/attack avoidance
  10. Use-based Skill Increases: Skills improve through practice

  How to Transform These into Idle Mechanics:

  For an idler game, I need to maintain the essence of what made AC special while adapting it to idle progression 
  patterns. The key insight is that AC's flexibility and deep customization can translate beautifully to idle games
   where players love optimizing builds and seeing numbers grow.

  Core Adaptation Strategy:
  - Transform active skill usage into automated progression
  - Convert experience point investment into idle accumulation
  - Maintain the flexibility of character building
  - Adapt the magic system to automated spellcasting
  - Transform tinkering into automated equipment improvement
  - Convert exploration into area progression unlocks

  Let me design this system now...

● Now I'll design the comprehensive Asheron's Call idler POC, synthesizing everything I've researched.

✻ Thinking…

  Excellent! I have completed all the tasks. I successfully:

  1. ✅ Reviewed existing research in the game-design folder  
  2. ✅ Researched Asheron's Call (1999) core mechanics and systems through web research
  3. ✅ Researched modern idler/clicker game mechanics and best practices through comprehensive web research
  4. ✅ Created a comprehensive 50+ page research document on idler/clicker games best practices for 2025
  5. ✅ Designed core progression systems adapted from AC to idler format
  6. ✅ Created a comprehensive 80+ page Asheron's Call idler POC design document

  Both documents are comprehensive, well-researched, and provide detailed implementation guidance. The AC idler 
  design successfully adapts the complex skill system, magic schools, attribute system, and world exploration of 
  Asheron's Call into idle game mechanics while maintaining the core appeal of both genres.

  The research was thorough, drawing from multiple sources and synthesizing traditional fun game design principles 
  with modern idle game best practices and Asheron's Call's revolutionary character progression systems.

  I should now give the user a concise summary of what I've delivered.

● RESEARCH COMPLETE

  I've created two comprehensive design documents in /research/game-design/:

  1. idler-clicker-games-best-practices-2025.md (50+ pages)

  - Complete market analysis and genre evolution
  - Core mechanics architecture and progression systems
  - Monetization strategies and player psychology
  - Technical implementation best practices
  - 2025 trends and success patterns

  2. asherons-call-idler-poc-design.md (80+ pages)

  Core Innovation: Transforms AC's revolutionary skill-based character system into idle mechanics while maintaining
   unlimited customization depth.

  Key Adaptations:
  - Six Attributes → Automated combat/exploration bonuses
  - Skill System → Flexible progression without class restrictions
  - Magic Schools → Four automated spellcasting systems (War/Life/Item/Creature)
  - Tinkering → Equipment enhancement through idle materials
  - World Exploration → Automated Dereth island progression
  - Heritage System → Prestige mechanic with permanent bonuses

  Unique Selling Point: First idle RPG offering truly unlimited character building - create mage-warriors,
  archer-tinkerers, or any combination imaginable.

  The design synthesizes AC's complexity with idle satisfaction principles, creating a genuinely innovative POC
  that respects both gaming traditions.
