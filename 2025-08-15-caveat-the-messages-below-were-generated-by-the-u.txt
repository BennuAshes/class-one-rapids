● Patterns Identified

  Structure Pattern:
  - Each spec directory contains exactly 3 files: design.md, requirements.md, tasks.md
  - Consistent naming and organization across features

  Content Format Patterns:

  design.md:
  - Technical architecture document format
  - Sections: Overview, Architecture, Components/Interfaces, Data Models, Error
  Handling, Testing Strategy, Performance Considerations
  - Includes TypeScript code examples and interface definitions
  - Focuses on implementation details and system design

  requirements.md:
  - Business requirements format with user stories
  - Structure: Introduction, numbered requirements with user stories and acceptance
  criteria
  - Uses WHEN/THEN/IF formal acceptance criteria format
  - Links requirements to user needs and business value

  tasks.md:
  - Implementation checklist format
  - Tasks marked with completion status: [x] completed, [ ] pending
  - Each task includes bullet points with specific implementation steps
  - Maps tasks to requirement numbers for traceability
  - Sequential implementation order with dependencies

  Content Type Patterns:
  - Game development focused (character systems, mobile app development)
  - Cross-platform development (iOS, Android, web)
  - Modern React Native/TypeScript stack
  - State management and persistence emphasis

> What are you missing to be able to recreate these from some simple prompts?

● Looking at the patterns, to recreate these specification documents from simple
  prompts, I would need:

  Missing Context:
  1. Project domain knowledge - Understanding of Asheron's Call game mechanics, idle RPG
   conventions, and mobile game design patterns
  2. Technical stack preferences - Why Legend-state, MMKV, Expo Router were chosen over
  alternatives
  3. Architecture decisions - The reasoning behind vertical slicing, specific state
  management patterns, and cross-platform considerations

  Missing Templates/Standards:
  1. Acceptance criteria format - The specific WHEN/THEN/IF structure and phrasing
  patterns
  2. Task breakdown methodology - How to decompose features into implementable chunks
  with proper dependencies
  3. Documentation depth guidelines - Level of technical detail expected in each section

  Missing Process Knowledge:
  1. Requirement traceability - How tasks map back to specific requirement numbers
  2. Implementation sequencing - The logic for ordering tasks and marking completion
  status
  3. Error handling patterns - Standard approaches for validation, data integrity, and
  recovery

  What I Could Generate:
  - Basic document structure (the 3-file pattern is clear)
  - General technical concepts and TypeScript interfaces
  - High-level user stories and acceptance criteria

  What I'd Need to Match Quality:
  - Domain-specific terminology and concepts
  - Established architectural patterns for this type of app
  - Project-specific coding standards and conventions
  - The specific balance of technical depth vs. business clarity

  The documents show deep domain expertise and established development practices that
  would require either extensive prompting or access to project standards/examples.

> what determines if you are in "plan mode"

● I am not currently in "plan mode." Plan mode is determined by specific conditions in
  Claude Code:

  1. User explicitly requests planning - When you ask me to plan implementation steps
  for a coding task
  2. Complex implementation tasks - When a task requires multiple steps and would
  benefit from upfront planning before execution
  3. ExitPlanMode tool availability - Plan mode is active when I have access to and
  should use the ExitPlanMode tool

  When I'm in plan mode:
  - I focus on creating implementation plans rather than immediately executing code
  - I use the ExitPlanMode tool to present my plan and get user approval before
  proceeding
  - The goal is to think through the approach before taking action

  When I'm NOT in plan mode (like now):
  - I directly execute tasks and write code as requested
  - I use TodoWrite for task tracking but don't require explicit approval to proceed
  - I can immediately start implementing solutions

  The key indicator is whether I need to use ExitPlanMode to get approval before
  proceeding with implementation. Right now, since you're asking about analysis and
  patterns rather than requesting implementation of a complex coding task, I'm in normal
   execution mode.

> when I asked, "What are you missing to be able to recreate these from some simple 
  prompts?" - lets assume you have domain knowledge (eg understanding of Asheron's 
  Call). What are you missing in terms of creating the patterns expressed within? How 
  the files are formatted. Do you have enough knowledge of PRDs? What about breaking 
  down technical user stories?

● Looking at this from a pure format and structural pattern perspective, assuming I have
   the domain knowledge:

  What I have sufficient knowledge of:
  - PRD structure - I understand requirements documents, user stories, acceptance
  criteria formats
  - Technical documentation - Architecture docs, API specs, design documents
  - Agile breakdown - Converting epics to stories to tasks with dependencies

  What I'm missing for pattern recreation:

  1. Specific Document Templates:
  - The exact sectioning conventions (why those specific sections in that order)
  - Depth calibration - knowing when to stop/start detail in each section
  - Cross-reference patterns - how tasks link to requirements (the "Requirements: 1.1, 
  1.2" format)

  2. Writing Style Consistency:
  - Voice and tone patterns across document types
  - Technical precision level - the balance between implementation detail and
  architectural overview
  - Acceptance criteria formulation - the specific WHEN/THEN/IF structure and phrasing
  patterns

  3. Content Scoping Rules:
  - What belongs where - why certain technical details go in design.md vs tasks.md
  - Completeness standards - how comprehensive each section should be
  - Abstraction levels - when to show code examples vs conceptual descriptions

  4. Workflow Integration:
  - Status tracking conventions - the checkbox patterns and completion criteria
  - Dependency sequencing - the logic for task ordering and prerequisites
  - Iteration planning - how features get broken into implementable chunks

  I could generate functional documents with the right content, but matching the exact
  stylistic consistency and organizational logic would require seeing more examples or
  having explicit style guides for each document type.

> How well could you guess on creating an explicit style guide? Does this format have a 
  name, maybe I can feed you more research.

● I could create a reasonably good style guide by reverse-engineering these patterns,
  but it would be educated guesswork on several key aspects.

  What I could confidently extract:
  - Document structure templates
  - Section naming conventions
  - Cross-reference formatting patterns
  - Task breakdown methodology
  - Acceptance criteria syntax

  What I'd be guessing on:
  - Depth calibration rules - when to include code examples vs. high-level descriptions
  - Completeness thresholds - how much detail constitutes "sufficient"
  - Voice/tone guidelines - the specific writing style choices
  - Content allocation logic - why certain topics go in design vs. requirements

  Potential format names to research:

  1. "Feature Specification Trilogy" or "3-Document Feature Spec"
  2. "Vertical Slice Documentation" (matches the architecture approach)
  3. "Requirements-Design-Tasks" (RDT) methodology
  4. "Agile Feature Documentation Standard"
  5. "Product-Engineering Specification Framework"

  Related methodologies that might inform this:
  - Shape Up (Basecamp) - has similar multi-document approaches
  - PRD + Technical Design Doc patterns from FAANG companies
  - Agile Epic breakdown methodologies
  - Feature-driven development documentation standards

  Best research directions:
  1. "Software feature documentation templates"
  2. "Agile requirements design tasks workflow"
  3. "Product engineering handoff documentation"
  4. "Technical specification trilogy patterns"

  The format feels like an evolution of standard product/engineering handoff practices.
  Do any of those terms ring familiar, or should I focus the style guide extraction on
  what I can observe?

> Yes I think they're all familiar and centered around the same idea. Are you able to 
  identify the 3 main file types as part of one or more of these processes?

● Yes! Looking at the 3-file pattern through these methodologies:

  requirements.md = Product Requirements Document (PRD)
  - User stories with business justification
  - Acceptance criteria in formal WHEN/THEN format
  - Focus on what and why from user perspective
  - Maps to Product Owner/PM responsibilities

  design.md = Technical Design Document (TDD)
  - System architecture and implementation approach
  - Code interfaces, data models, error handling
  - Focus on how from engineering perspective
  - Maps to Engineering/Architecture responsibilities

  tasks.md = Sprint/Epic Breakdown
  - Actionable implementation tickets
  - Task dependencies and sequencing
  - Requirement traceability back to PRD items
  - Maps to Development Team execution

  This follows the classic Product → Engineering → Development handoff:

  1. Product defines requirements (user needs, acceptance criteria)
  2. Engineering designs solution (architecture, technical approach)
  3. Development breaks into tasks (implementable work items)

  Methodology alignment:
  - Shape Up: Pitch → Solution → Bets (similar progression)
  - SAFe: Epic → Feature → Story breakdown
  - Feature-driven development: Feature → Design → Build sequence

  The 3-document pattern is essentially a formalized handoff workflow that ensures
  nothing gets lost between product vision and implementation execution. Each document
  serves a different audience but maintains traceability.

  This explains the specific sectioning and cross-references - it's optimized for
  multi-role collaboration while maintaining single sources of truth for each concern.
