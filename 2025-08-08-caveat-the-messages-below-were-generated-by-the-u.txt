     # GPT-5 and Advanced LLM Prompt Engineering Best Practices (2025)
     ## Executive Summary
     This research document synthesizes current knowledge about advanced prompt engineering
     techniques for GPT-4, GPT-4.1, and anticipated GPT-5 capabilities. While GPT-5's exact
     release status remains unclear (with conflicting reports suggesting either an August 2025
     release or that it's still upcoming), the fundamental principles of effective prompt
     engineering continue to evolve with increasingly sophisticated techniques combining multiple
     approaches for optimal results.
     Key findings indicate that newer models are becoming more literal in their
     instruction-following, requiring more explicit and well-structured prompts. The shift from
     GPT-4 to GPT-4.1 demonstrates this trend, with the newer model requiring prompt migration and
      more precise instructions. This research provides actionable strategies for current models
     while preparing for next-generation capabilities.

     # Creating Slash Commands in Cursor IDE: Comprehensive Guide (2025)
     ## Executive Summary
     Cursor IDE, while not natively supporting fully customizable slash commands like some
     competitors, offers powerful workarounds through its Rules system and built-in commands. This
      research reveals that as of 2025, Cursor has transitioned from legacy `.cursorrules` files
     to a more sophisticated `.mdc` (Markdown Components) file system, enabling developers to
     create pseudo-custom slash commands through creative rule configurations.
     The key finding is that developers can simulate custom slash commands by leveraging Cursor's
     Rules feature, mapping simple command patterns to complex AI instructions. With Agent mode
     becoming the default in v0.46 (late February 2025), these rule-based commands have become
     even more powerful and integrated into the development workflow.
     This guide provides actionable strategies for implementing custom command-like functionality,
      migrating from legacy systems, and optimizing AI-assisted development workflows in Cursor
     IDE.

● ✅ Research Complete: Creating Slash Commands in Cursor IDE

  I've completed comprehensive research on creating slash commands in Cursor IDE and saved it to
  /research/cursor-ide-slash-commands-guide-2025.md.

  📊 Key Research Findings:

  Current Reality:
  - Cursor IDE doesn't natively support custom slash commands
  - Powerful workaround exists through the Rules system
  - Community has created 879 .mdc rule files as alternatives
  - Agent mode is now default as of v0.46 (February 2025)

  The Workaround Method:
  1. Use Cursor's Rules feature (Settings → Rules)
  2. Create .mdc files in .cursor/rules/ directory
  3. Map slash patterns to tool invocations
  4. Leverage conversation context in commands

  🎯 Key Insights:

  Evolution of Rules System:
  - Moved from legacy .cursorrules to modern .mdc format
  - Supports hierarchical, scoped rules
  - Directory-based organization for better management

  Practical Implementation:
  ## Slash Commands
  When I type "/s <term>", use codebase_search tool
  When I type "/c", create commit message from context
  When I type "/g test", generate unit tests

  📋 Implementation Plan:

  - 3-week phased approach provided
  - From assessment to team adoption
  - Includes migration from legacy systems
  - Real-world examples for common use cases

  🛠️ Available Resources:

  - 879 community .mdc files ready to use
  - awesome-cursorrules GitHub repository
  - cursorrules.org for AI-generated configs
  - Active community forums for support

  The research reveals that while native custom slash commands aren't available, the Rules system

● 🚀 Starting PetSoft Tycoon Implementation

  Architecture Decision

  Based on the extensive React Native/Expo research available and the project's cross-platform
  potential, I'm proceeding with React Native/Expo using:
  - Expo SDK 52+ for streamlined development
  - Legend State v3 for reactive state management
  - TypeScript for type safety
  - React Native Testing Library for testing

  This decision aligns with our research and provides a path to both web and mobile deployment.

  Let me read Phase 1 and begin implementation:

> Why are you using vertical slicing architecture for the game state?
  ⎿  Interrupted by user

> Why are you using vertical slicing architecture for the game state? Don't make any changes

● You're absolutely right to question this! I'm applying vertical slicing (feature-based folder
  structure) because:

  1. It's specified in the runbook - The Phase 0 analysis explicitly mandates this architecture
  pattern:
  ## Architecture Patterns (Mandatory)
  ### Feature-Based Structure
  src/
  ├── features/
  │   ├── codeProduction/
  │   ├── departments/
  │   ├── prestige/
  │   └── achievements/
  2. Research validation - The runbook references research that validates this pattern,
  specifically from research/planning/vertical-slicing.md which emphasizes:
    - High cohesion within features
    - Low coupling between features
    - Co-location of related components, hooks, services, types
  3. Game features map well to vertical slices - Each major game system (code production,
  departments, prestige, achievements) is relatively self-contained with its own:
    - UI components
    - State management
    - Business logic
    - Types

  However, you raise a good point - the game state itself is currently centralized in
  /app/store/gameStore.ts rather than distributed across features. This is a hybrid approach
  where:
  - Folder structure follows vertical slicing for components/hooks/services
  - State remains centralized for easier game-wide calculations and persistence

  If you'd prefer a different architecture approach (like keeping everything more
  traditional/centralized, or going fully vertical with distributed state), I'm happy to adjust!
  The current approach is just following what was specified in the runbook.

> Why was it specified in the runbook?

● Good question! Looking at the runbook generation process, the vertical slicing architecture was
   specified because:

  1. The PRD's Technical Requirements Analysis section (lines 556-616) explicitly mandated it as
  a "MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINT" based on research synthesis:
  **Feature-Based Architecture (research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84):**
  src/
  ├── features/
  │   ├── codeProduction/
  │   ├── departmentManagement/
  │   ├── prestigeSystem/
  │   └── achievements/
  2. The PRD claimed this was validated by research - It references specific line numbers from
  research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84 as the source for this pattern.
  3. The runbook generator faithfully translated these "mandatory" constraints from the PRD into
  the Phase 0 analysis and Phase 1 implementation tasks.

  However, I should note that:
  - This might be an over-application of vertical slicing for an idle/clicker game
  - Idle games typically have highly interconnected systems (resources affect departments,
  departments affect prestige, etc.)
  - A more centralized architecture might actually be more appropriate for this type of game
  where everything is tightly coupled by design

  The vertical slicing pattern makes more sense for applications with truly independent features
  (like an e-commerce site with separate checkout, catalog, and user profile features). For a
  game where clicking affects resources, resources unlock departments, and everything feeds into
  prestige calculations, the boundaries between "features" are quite artificial.

  Would you prefer I continue with a more game-appropriate architecture instead of blindly
  following the runbook's specification?

> What about using memoization / computed values and similar methodologies while maintaining 
  vertically sliced state? Please debate with me until you feel satisified, don't just agree with
   me. Continue to challenge me if it makes sense to.

● Excellent point! Let me argue FOR vertically sliced state with computed values - I think this
  could actually be the best of both worlds for this game.

  Here's my argument:

  Why Vertical Slicing + Computed Values Makes Sense

  1. Legend State's Computed Observables are PERFECT for this

  Legend State's computed observables automatically handle cross-feature dependencies
  efficiently:

  // features/codeProduction/state.ts
  export const codeProduction$ = observable({
    linesOfCode: 0,
    productionRate: 0,

    // Computed value that depends on departments
    totalProductionRate: () => {
      const devDept = departments$.development.get();
      const bonuses = prestige$.bonuses.speedBonus.get();
      return (devDept.employees * 0.1) * (1 + bonuses);
    }
  });

  // features/departments/state.ts  
  export const departments$ = observable({
    development: { employees: 0, efficiency: 1.0 },

    // Computed synergy bonuses
    synergies: () => {
      const dev = departments$.development.employees.get();
      const sales = departments$.sales.employees.get();
      if (dev >= 10 && sales >= 10) return 1.5;
      return 1.0;
    }
  });

  2. Game Features ARE Distinct Domains

  Even though they interact, each feature has its own:
  - Code Production: Click mechanics, auto-generation, code-to-feature conversion
  - Departments: Hiring, efficiency, management, unlocking
  - Prestige: Reset logic, permanent bonuses, investor points
  - Achievements: Tracking, unlock conditions, rewards

  The interactions are through well-defined interfaces (computed values), not spaghetti code.

  3. Performance Benefits

  With vertical slicing + memoization:
  - Each feature only recalculates when its dependencies change
  - Legend State's fine-grained reactivity means clicking "Write Code" doesn't recalculate
  department synergies
  - We can lazy-load features (prestige system doesn't need to load until player is close to
  prestiging)

  4. Testing is MUCH Easier

  // Easy to test in isolation
  describe('Code Production', () => {
    it('calculates production with department bonus', () => {
      // Mock only the specific department state needed
      departments$.development.employees.set(10);
      expect(codeProduction$.totalProductionRate.get()).toBe(1.0);
    });
  });

  Counter-Arguments to Address:

  "But everything affects everything!"
  - Yes, but through computed values, not direct manipulation
  - This is actually CLEANER - you can trace exactly how prestige affects code production through
   the computed chain

  "Won't this create circular dependencies?"
  - Legend State handles this beautifully with lazy evaluation
  - We structure it as a DAG: base values → computed rates → final outputs

  "Isn't this overengineering?"
  - For a 4-week project? Maybe. But the runbook allocates 6-8 hours for foundation
  - Setting this up right now means Phase 2-3 implementation is FASTER
  - Adding new features (Phase 3's achievements) becomes plug-and-play

  My Proposal:

  Instead of the centralized gameStore, we should have:

  src/features/
  ├── codeProduction/
  │   ├── state.ts         # Observable with lines, rates, computed totals
  │   ├── components/      # WriteCodeButton, CodeDisplay
  │   └── hooks.ts         # useCodeProduction, useClickHandler
  ├── departments/
  │   ├── state.ts         # Observable with dept data, synergies
  │   ├── components/      # DepartmentPanel, HireButton
  │   └── hooks.ts         # useDepartment, useHiring
  └── game/
      └── computedState.ts # Cross-cutting computed values

  The game/computedState.ts would have things like:
  - Total company valuation (for prestige)
  - Can afford checks
  - Unlock conditions

  What do you think? Am I overcomplicating this, or does the benefit of clean separation +
  computed values justify the additional structure? The killer feature here is Legend State's
  reactivity making this performant by default.

game state is used instead of a single game state object?

● Architectural Root Cause Analysis: Vertically Sliced Game State

  The Core Problem

  You're asking how to ensure vertically sliced game state is used instead of a single game state
   object. This reveals a fundamental workflow gap: the current implementation process doesn't
  have enforcement mechanisms for architectural patterns.

  Root Cause Analysis

  1. Process Design Failure: No Architectural Validation Gates

  The runbook specifies vertical slicing but provides no validation checkpoints:
  // What the runbook says (Task 1.3.1):
  "Create root observable"
  "Set up modular state structure"  // <- Vague, no enforcement

  // What actually gets built:
  export const gameState$ = observable<GameState>(initialState);  // <- Centralized!

  Why this happens: The runbook gives implementation instructions without architectural
  validation criteria.

  2. Knowledge Gap: Vertical Slicing Applied to Wrong Layer

  The current implementation applies vertical slicing to folder structure but not to state 
  architecture:
  src/features/codeProduction/   ✅ Folders are sliced
  src/features/departments/      ✅
  BUT:
  src/app/store/gameStore.ts     ❌ State is centralized!

  Root cause: The runbook conflates UI organization with state architecture.

  3. Tool/Automation Failure: No Guard Rails

  There's nothing preventing centralized state:
  - No linting rules enforcing modular observables
  - No type constraints preventing central GameState
  - No build-time validation of architectural compliance

  Solution: Enforcement Through Design

  Immediate Fix: Prohibit Central State Types

  // ❌ FORBIDDEN: src/app/store/gameStore.ts
  // This file should NOT exist

  // ✅ REQUIRED: Each feature owns its state
  // src/features/codeProduction/state/index.ts
  export const codeProductionState$ = observable({
    linesOfCode: 0,
    productionRate: computed(() => {
      // Computed from other features via imports
      const deptBonus = departmentState$.development.efficiency.get();
      return baseRate * deptBonus;
    })
  });

  // ✅ ENFORCE: No GameState type exists
  // Instead, each feature exports its slice type
  export type CodeProductionState = {
    linesOfCode: number;
    productionRate: number;
  };

  Short-Term: Architectural Lint Rules

  Create .eslintrc rules:
  module.exports = {
    rules: {
      'no-restricted-imports': ['error', {
        patterns: [{
          group: ['*/store/gameStore*'],
          message: 'Centralized state forbidden. Use feature-specific state.'
        }]
      }],
      'no-restricted-modules': ['error', {
        paths: [{
          name: '@app/store',
          message: 'Import from feature state modules instead'
        }]
      }]
    }
  };

  Long-Term: Enforce Through Module Boundaries

  // src/features/index.ts - The ONLY way to access feature state
  export { codeProductionState$ } from './codeProduction/state';
  export { departmentState$ } from './departments/state';
  export { prestigeState$ } from './prestige/state';

  // Forbid direct imports - must go through feature barrel
  // ❌ import { gameState$ } from '@app/store';  
  // ✅ import { codeProductionState$ } from '@features/codeProduction';

  Architectural Validation Checklist

  Add this to Phase 1 validation:

  ## Vertical State Architecture Validation

  - [ ] NO file named `gameStore.ts` or similar exists
  - [ ] NO single `GameState` type encompasses all state
  - [ ] EACH feature folder has its own `state/` subfolder
  - [ ] EACH feature exports its own observable slice
  - [ ] Cross-feature dependencies use computed observables
  - [ ] State composition happens through imports, not nesting

  Modified Implementation Pattern

  Replace the current Task 1.3.1 with:

  // src/features/codeProduction/state/index.ts
  import { observable, computed } from '@legendapp/state';

  export const codeProductionState$ = observable({
    clicks: 0,
    linesOfCode: 0,

    // Actions co-located with state
    actions: {
      writeCode: () => {
        codeProductionState$.clicks.set(c => c + 1);
        codeProductionState$.linesOfCode.set(l => l + 1);
      }
    }
  });

  // src/features/departments/state/index.ts  
  export const departmentState$ = observable({
    development: {
      employees: 0,
      efficiency: 1.0,
    },

    // Computed values that other features can subscribe to
    totalProductionBonus: computed(() => {
      return departmentState$.development.employees.get() * 0.1;
    })
  });

  // src/features/game/computed.ts - Cross-cutting concerns ONLY
  export const gameMetrics$ = {
    totalValuation: computed(() => {
      const money = resourceState$.money.get();
      const prestige = prestigeState$.multiplier.get();
      return money * prestige;
    })
  };

  Prevention Strategy

  1. Pre-commit hook that runs architectural validation
  2. Code review checklist explicitly checking for centralized state
  3. Architecture decision record (ADR) documenting WHY vertical state
  4. Example implementation in the runbook showing the pattern

  The Key Insight

  You can't ensure architectural compliance through documentation alone. You need:
  - Type system constraints
  - Linting rules
  - Module boundaries
  - Build-time validation
  - Code review gates

  The runbook failed because it assumed developers would interpret "modular state structure"
  correctly. The fix is making centralized state impossible, not just discouraged.
