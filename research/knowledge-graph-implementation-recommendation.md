# Knowledge Graph Implementation Recommendation

## ❌ Shell Script is NOT the Right Approach

Based on your context and research, **shell scripts are completely inadequate** for knowledge graph generation. Here's why:

### Your Context:
- You have sophisticated Claude Code commands (`.claude/commands/`)
- You already use structured markdown commands for research compression
- Knowledge graph extraction requires NLP, entity resolution, and LLM API calls
- Shell scripts can't handle complex data structures or API interactions effectively

### Evidence from Research:
- **Every major implementation uses Python** (LangChain, Neo4j, KGGen)
- Shell scripts limited to basic piping: `cat file | llm > output`
- No entity resolution, deduplication, or relationship inference in bash
- Can't manage schemas, handle JSON graphs, or do semantic clustering

## ✅ Recommended Approaches (In Order)

### 1. **Claude Code Command** (Best for your workflow)
Create `.claude/commands/research/build-knowledge-graph.md`:
```markdown
---
description: Extract knowledge graph from research files
argument-hint: <research-folder> [output-format]
allowed-tools: ["Read", "Write", "Task", "WebFetch"]
---

<command>
  <role>Knowledge Graph Architect with expertise in entity extraction, relationship mapping, and semantic clustering</role>
  
  <extraction_strategy>
    # Similar to your compress-research.md pattern
    - Extract entities (concepts, tools, patterns)
    - Identify relationships (depends-on, contradicts, informs)
    - Deduplicate and cluster
    - Output as JSON graph
  </extraction_strategy>
  
  <execution>
    1. Read all research files
    2. Extract triples using LLM reasoning
    3. Build graph structure
    4. Write to graph.json
  </execution>
</command>
```

### 2. **Python Script with LangChain** (Most powerful)
```python
# research-to-graph.py
from langchain.graphs import LLMGraphTransformer
from langchain.document_loaders import DirectoryLoader

# Load research files
loader = DirectoryLoader('./research/', glob="**/*.md")
docs = loader.load()

# Extract graph
transformer = LLMGraphTransformer(
    llm=llm,
    node_types=["Research", "Pattern", "Tool", "Decision"],
    relationship_types=["informs", "depends_on", "contradicts"]
)
graph = transformer.convert_to_graph_documents(docs)

# Save as JSON for Claude Code
with open('research-graph.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(graph.to_dict(), f)
```

Then call from Claude Code:
```bash
python research-to-graph.py
```

### 3. **MCP Server** (For dynamic queries)
Create an MCP server that:
- Maintains the knowledge graph
- Responds to Claude Code queries
- Updates as research changes
- Returns only relevant context

## Validation Resources

### Academic/Industry Standards:
- [LangChain Graph Construction](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/graph_constructing/) - Official docs showing Python-only approach
- [Neo4j LLM Graph Builder](https://neo4j.com/labs/genai-ecosystem/llm-graph-builder/) - Industry tool, Python-based
- [KGGen Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2502.09956v1) - Latest research (2025), uses Python

### Why Python Dominates:
1. **LLM Integration**: Native OpenAI/Anthropic SDK support
2. **Graph Libraries**: NetworkX, PyG, RDFlib
3. **Entity Resolution**: SpaCy, NLTK for NLP
4. **Data Structures**: Native dict/list for complex graphs
5. **Schema Management**: Pydantic for validation

### Shell Script Reality Check:
```bash
# This is ALL shell can do:
cat research/*.md | \
  curl -X POST api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions \
  -d '{"prompt": "extract entities"}' | \
  jq '.entities' > entities.json

# Can't:
# - Deduplicate entities
# - Build relationship graphs  
# - Handle schema validation
# - Manage state between chunks
# - Do semantic clustering
```

## Recommended Implementation Path

1. **Start with Claude Code command** (follows your existing patterns)
2. **If you need more power**, write a Python script
3. **For production**, consider MCP server for dynamic queries
4. **Never use shell scripts** for knowledge graph work

## Your Specific Use Case

Given that you want to **replace quick-ref.md** with a knowledge graph:

```python
# Minimal Python implementation
import json
from pathlib import Path

def extract_graph(research_dir):
    """Extract graph from research files"""
    graph = {"nodes": [], "edges": []}
    
    for file in Path(research_dir).glob("**/*.md"):
        # Use LLM to extract entities and relationships
        # Add to graph structure
        pass
    
    return graph

def query_graph(graph, topic):
    """Return relevant nodes for topic"""
    # Simple graph traversal
    relevant = []
    # ... implementation
    return relevant

# Save graph
graph = extract_graph("./research")
json.dump(graph, open("research-graph.json", "w"))
```

Then in CLAUDE.md:
```markdown
# No more @research/quick-ref.md!
@research/research-graph.json  # Smaller, structured
```

## Conclusion

Shell scripts are **categorically wrong** for knowledge graph generation. Use:
1. Claude Code commands (easiest, fits your workflow)
2. Python scripts (most powerful, industry standard)
3. MCP servers (for advanced integration)

Every resource confirms: **Python + LLM libraries** is the only serious approach for knowledge graph extraction in 2025.
