# Context Engineering System Improvement Ideas

## Workflow & Process Improvements
1. **Add rollback/undo functionality** - When auto-corrections go wrong
2. **Parallel phase execution** - Run validation while generating runbooks
3. **Resume from checkpoint** - Continue workflows from interruption points
4. **Dependency graph visualization** - Show research→PRD→runbook→execution flow

## Research & Validation Enhancements
5. **Version compatibility matrix** - Track which package versions work together
6. **Automated research updates** - Scan for new package versions periodically
7. **Conflict resolution UI** - Interactive choices when research conflicts exist
8. **Research confidence scoring** - Rate how well-tested each research item is

## Developer Experience
9. **IDE integration** - VS Code extension for running commands in-context
10. **Progress dashboard** - Real-time view of all active projects/runbooks
11. **Command preview mode** - Show what will be executed before running
12. **Smart project detection** - Auto-detect project type and suggest appropriate workflows

## Quality & Reliability
13. **Dry-run mode** - Test entire workflow without making changes
14. **Automated testing of generated runbooks** - Spin up containers to validate
15. **Error recovery patterns** - Handle common failure scenarios gracefully
16. **Audit logging** - Track all auto-corrections and decisions made

## Scalability & Organization
17. **Multi-tenant support** - Different teams with different research bases
18. **Template inheritance** - Base templates with team-specific overrides
19. **Batch processing** - Run multiple projects through workflow simultaneously
20. **Research caching** - Speed up repeated validations
