# Pattern Language Extraction Strategy for Quick-Ref Generation
*Created: 2025-08-10*
*Purpose: Improving architectural pattern extraction from research to quick-ref.md*

## Executive Summary

The current quick-ref.md generation loses critical architectural context by extracting only pattern names without implementation details. This document proposes a **Pattern Language Extraction Strategy** based on the Gang of Four (GoF) pattern documentation format, combined with modern LLM context optimization techniques.

## The Core Problem

### Current State
```markdown
# Current extraction result
Patterns: vertical slicing, horizontal layers

# Problem: Just the names, no context!
```

### Result
```markdown
| vertical slicing | horizontal layers |  // No context!
```

### Consequence
Implementers see "vertical slicing" but create centralized `gameStore.ts` - completely missing the point.

## Formal Terminology: Design Pattern Template

The structure I proposed (term/implementation/principle/anti-pattern) is formally known as the **"Gang of Four (GoF) Pattern Format"** or **"Alexandrian Pattern Language"**.

### Standard Pattern Elements:
1. **Pattern Name** - The term (e.g., "vertical slicing")
2. **Intent** - The principle/problem it solves
3. **Solution** - The implementation approach
4. **Consequences** - Trade-offs and anti-patterns
5. **Forces** - Context where it applies

## Proposed Pattern Language Extraction Strategy

### Phase 1: Enhanced Extraction Algorithm

#### 1.1 Context-Aware Pattern Extraction
```markdown
# Pattern Extraction Template

## From research text:
"Vertical slicing enables independent development by ensuring each feature owns its complete stack, avoiding centralized stores."

## Extract into structured format:
**Pattern**: vertical-slicing
**Intent**: enables independent development
**Solution**: each feature owns complete stack
**Anti-pattern**: centralized stores
**Forces**: team size > 1, need parallel development

## Compression markers to look for:
- Intent markers: "to", "for", "enables", "allows"
- Solution markers: "by", "using", "with", "through"
- Anti-pattern markers: "not", "avoid", "instead of", "don't"
```

#### 1.2 Semantic Clustering
Group related concepts together:
```markdown
# Pattern Clusters

## State Management
- observable
- store
- state
- reactive
- @legendapp/state

## Architecture
- vertical slicing
- feature-based
- modular
- bounded contexts

## Testing
- jest
- testing-library
- unit tests
- integration tests
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Level Pattern Documentation

#### Level 1: Pattern Summary (Critical - Always Loaded)
```markdown
| Pattern | Intent | Anti-Pattern |
|---------|--------|--------------|
| vertical slicing | Each feature owns complete stack | Centralized state stores |
| observable state | Per-feature reactive stores | Single global observable |
```

#### Level 2: Implementation Details (Loaded for Development)
```markdown
### Pattern: Vertical Slicing
**Intent**: Isolate features for independent development and testing
**Solution**: 
```
features/
  departments/
    state/departmentStore.ts  # Feature owns state
    components/               # Feature owns UI
    hooks/                   # Feature owns logic
```
**Anti-Pattern Example**:
```
core/state/gameStore.ts  # ❌ Central store for all features
```
```

#### Level 3: Forces and Context (Loaded for Architecture Decisions)
```markdown
### When to Use Vertical Slicing
**Forces**:
- Team size > 3 developers (reduce merge conflicts)
- Features have distinct boundaries
- Need for parallel development
- Microservices migration path desired

**Consequences**:
- ✅ Independent testing and deployment
- ✅ Reduced coupling
- ⚠️ Potential code duplication
- ⚠️ Need for composition patterns
```

### Phase 3: Semantic Compression Strategy

Based on LLM Context Optimization Research findings:

#### 3.1 Importance Scoring
```markdown
# Pattern Importance Scoring

## Scoring Criteria
| Factor | Points | Example |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Mention frequency | ×10 | "vertical slicing" (47 mentions) = 470 |
| Critical markers | +50 | Contains "critical", "must", "required" |
| Multi-file validation | ×5 | Appears in 3 files = +15 |
| Has examples | +20 | Includes implementation example |

## Example Score Calculation
Pattern: vertical-slicing
- Mentions: 47 × 10 = 470
- Critical marker: "required pattern" = +50
- Files: 3 × 5 = 15
- Has example: Yes = +20
**Total Score: 555 (Critical Priority)**
```

#### 3.2 Dynamic Context Pruning
```markdown
# Context-Based Pattern Selection

## Query: "Help with state management"
### Load these patterns:
- observable-state (cluster: state-management)
- @legendapp/state (cluster: state-management)
- per-feature-stores (cluster: state-management)
- vertical-slicing (score > 80, always include)

## Query: "Architecture review"
### Load these patterns:
- vertical-slicing (cluster: architecture)
- feature-folders (cluster: architecture)
- bounded-contexts (cluster: architecture)
- All patterns with score > 60

## Default: Load high-priority only
- Patterns with score > 60
- Patterns marked "critical"
```

### Phase 4: Validation and Testing

#### 4.1 Pattern Completeness Check
```markdown
# Pattern Validation Checklist

## Required Fields
- [ ] Pattern name
- [ ] Intent (why use it)
- [ ] Solution (how to implement)

## Optional but Recommended
- [ ] Anti-pattern (what to avoid)
- [ ] Example (concrete implementation)
- [ ] Forces (when to use)

## Example Validation
❌ **Incomplete**:
```
Pattern: vertical-slicing
```

✅ **Complete**:
```
Pattern: vertical-slicing
Intent: Enable independent feature development
Solution: features/{name}/ owns complete stack
Anti-pattern: src/store/gameStore.ts
```
```

#### 4.2 Anti-Pattern Detection
```markdown
# Anti-Pattern Detection Rules

## For Pattern: vertical-slicing
### Check for violations:
- ❌ src/core/state/gameStore.ts exists
- ❌ src/store/ directory exists
- ❌ Cross-feature imports detected

### Violation Report Format:
```
VIOLATION: Centralized state store
Pattern: vertical-slicing
Location: src/core/state/gameStore.ts
Severity: ERROR
Fix: Move to features/*/state/
Guide: See L2 documentation
      });
    }
  }
  
  return violations;
}
```

### Phase 5: Knowledge Graph Integration

Following Microsoft GraphRAG approach:

#### 5.1 Pattern Relationships
```javascript
const patternGraph = {
  nodes: [
    { id: 'vertical-slicing', type: 'architecture' },
    { id: 'observable-state', type: 'state-management' },
    { id: 'feature-folders', type: 'structure' }
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: 'vertical-slicing', to: 'feature-folders', relation: 'requires' },
    { from: 'vertical-slicing', to: 'observable-state', relation: 'composed-with' }
  ]
};
```

#### 5.2 Hierarchical Clustering
```javascript
function clusterPatterns(patterns) {
  // Use Leiden algorithm for community detection
  const communities = {
    'architecture': ['vertical-slicing', 'feature-based', 'modular'],
    'state': ['observable', 'reactive', 'store-per-feature'],
    'performance': ['lazy-loading', 'code-splitting', 'memoization']
  };
  
  return communities;
}
```

## Research-Based Optimizations

### From LLM Context Optimization Research

1. **LLMLingua Integration**
   - Use GPT-2 model to identify important tokens
   - Achieve 20x compression on pattern descriptions
   - Maintain 98% semantic accuracy

2. **Hierarchical Loading**
   - L1: Pattern names + intents (100 tokens)
   - L2: Solutions + examples (500 tokens)
   - L3: Forces + consequences (300 tokens)
   - L4: Full implementation details (1000 tokens)

3. **Format Optimization**
   - Use Markdown for 15% better token efficiency
   - Table format for pattern summaries
   - Code blocks only when necessary

### From Vertical Slicing Research

1. **Feature Independence Validation**
   ```javascript
   function validateFeatureIndependence(feature) {
     const imports = extractImports(feature);
     const externalDeps = imports.filter(i => !i.startsWith('./'));
     
     // Features should only import from shared, not other features
     const featureImports = externalDeps.filter(i => 
       i.includes('/features/') && !i.includes(feature.name)
     );
     
     return featureImports.length === 0;
   }
   ```

2. **State Isolation Check**
   ```javascript
   function checkStateIsolation(feature) {
     const storeFiles = glob(`features/${feature}/state/*.ts`);
     const hasOwnStore = storeFiles.length > 0;
     const importsGlobalStore = searchForImport('gameStore', feature);
     
     return hasOwnStore && !importsGlobalStore;
   }
   ```

## Error Recovery Integration

Following the self-correcting system design from TODO.md:

### Pattern Violation Recovery
```javascript
function recoverFromViolation(violation) {
  const recovery = {
    pattern: violation.pattern,
    error: violation.description,
    solution: generateSolution(violation),
    researchUpdate: {
      file: `research/patterns/${violation.pattern}.md`,
      addition: formatLearning(violation, solution)
    }
  };
  
  // Stage for human review
  fs.writeFileSync(
    `research/proposed/${Date.now()}-${violation.pattern}.md`,
    recovery.researchUpdate.addition
  );
  
  return recovery;
}
```

## Conclusion

This Pattern Language Extraction Strategy addresses the critical gap between research knowledge and implementation by:

1. **Preserving Context**: Extracting not just pattern names but their intent, solution, and anti-patterns
2. **Enabling Validation**: Providing enough information to detect violations automatically
3. **Supporting Learning**: Building a knowledge graph that improves over time
4. **Optimizing Delivery**: Using hierarchical compression for efficient LLM context usage

The formal Pattern Language approach, combined with modern LLM optimization techniques, will significantly improve the quality of architectural implementations while reducing token usage by up to 95%.

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this strategy
2. Create proof-of-concept for vertical slicing pattern
3. Implement full extraction system
4. Integrate with existing quick-ref generation
5. Add error recovery and self-improvement loops
