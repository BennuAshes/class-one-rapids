# Knowledge Graphs Research for Claude Code

## Current Claude Code Memory System

Claude Code uses a **hierarchical file-based memory system**, not knowledge graphs:

- **CLAUDE.md files**: Hierarchical configuration files loaded recursively from project directories
- **Context window**: 200K tokens (500K on Enterprise) with Sonnet 4 and Opus 4.1
- **Memory capabilities**: Claude 4 models can create and maintain "memory files" for long-term task awareness
- **MCP Memory Keeper**: SQLite-based persistent context management across sessions
- **Quick Memory Pattern**: Prefix instructions with `#` to save to memory files

## Knowledge Graphs in AI Coding Tools (2025)

### What Are Code Knowledge Graphs?
- Structured representations of relationships and dependencies within codebases
- Dynamic maps connecting components, libraries, functions, modules, and documentation
- Capture structural information like inheritance, dependencies, and usage patterns

### Current Implementations
- **GitHub Copilot Enterprise**: Indexes organization codebases for deeper understanding
- **Cline**: MCP Marketplace (v3.4) with extensible ecosystem approach
- **Cursor**: Streamlined MCP handlers for common integrations
- No major AI coding assistant currently uses full knowledge graph architecture as primary system

### Key Benefits of Knowledge Graphs

1. **Enhanced Code Understanding**
   - Visualize interplay between code components
   - Understand impact of changes across codebase
   - Grasp design patterns and architectural decisions

2. **Improved Team Collaboration**
   - Better onboarding with dynamic codebase maps
   - Knowledge distribution across team members
   - Less vulnerability to key personnel changes

3. **Natural Language Interaction**
   - Query codebases with natural language questions
   - Transform queries into graph queries automatically
   - Example: "Which functions are most frequently called?"

4. **Automated Maintenance**
   - Self-updating documentation as code evolves
   - Continuous parsing keeps graph current
   - Reduces outdated documentation risk

## Analysis: Can You Benefit from Knowledge Graphs?

### Current Gaps in Claude Code
1. **No persistent cross-session relationship tracking** between code entities
2. **Limited structural understanding** - relies on text-based context
3. **No query capabilities** for codebase relationships
4. **Manual documentation updates** required in CLAUDE.md files

### Potential Benefits for Your Workflow

1. **Better Context Retention**
   - Track relationships between features (development, sales, etc.)
   - Understand state management dependencies
   - Map component interactions automatically

2. **Improved Code Navigation**
   - Query relationships: "What depends on developmentState$?"
   - Find unused functions or circular dependencies
   - Visualize impact of changes before making them

3. **Automated Documentation**
   - Generate relationship maps for your feature state pattern
   - Track computed observable dependencies
   - Document integration points automatically

### Implementation Approaches

1. **Lightweight Graph Layer**
   - Build graph representation using existing tools (Neo4j, FalkorDB)
   - Parse codebase to extract relationships
   - Query graph before making changes

2. **MCP Server Extension**
   - Create custom MCP server for graph operations
   - Integrate with Claude Code's existing MCP support
   - Maintain graph alongside CLAUDE.md files

3. **Hybrid Approach**
   - Use CLAUDE.md for instructions and patterns
   - Add graph layer for relationship tracking
   - Query both systems for comprehensive understanding

## Recommendations

### Short-term (Immediate Benefits)
1. **Continue using CLAUDE.md effectively** - it's Claude Code's native system
2. **Document relationships manually** in CLAUDE.md for critical dependencies
3. **Use Quick Memory Pattern** (`#` prefix) for capturing important context

### Medium-term (Consider Implementing)
1. **Build lightweight dependency graph** for your state management pattern
2. **Create visualization** of feature state relationships
3. **Use existing tools** (GraphQL, dependency analyzers) to track relationships

### Long-term (Future Possibilities)
1. **Monitor Claude Code updates** for potential knowledge graph features
2. **Experiment with MCP servers** for custom graph integration
3. **Consider hybrid approaches** combining file-based and graph-based memory

## Conclusion

Claude Code doesn't currently use knowledge graphs - it relies on hierarchical file-based memory (CLAUDE.md) and context windows. While knowledge graphs offer significant benefits for understanding complex codebases, you can achieve many benefits through:

1. Effective use of existing CLAUDE.md system
2. Clear documentation of relationships and patterns
3. Strategic use of MCP extensions if needed

Knowledge graphs would be most beneficial for:
- Large codebases with complex dependencies
- Teams needing better onboarding and knowledge sharing
- Projects requiring frequent impact analysis

For your current workflow with feature state patterns and computed observables, a lightweight dependency tracking system could provide immediate value without full knowledge graph implementation.
