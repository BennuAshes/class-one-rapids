# Creating Slash Commands in Cursor IDE: Comprehensive Guide (2025)

## Executive Summary

Cursor IDE, while not natively supporting fully customizable slash commands like some competitors, offers powerful workarounds through its Rules system and built-in commands. This research reveals that as of 2025, Cursor has transitioned from legacy `.cursorrules` files to a more sophisticated `.mdc` (Markdown Components) file system, enabling developers to create pseudo-custom slash commands through creative rule configurations.

The key finding is that developers can simulate custom slash commands by leveraging Cursor's Rules feature, mapping simple command patterns to complex AI instructions. With Agent mode becoming the default in v0.46 (late February 2025), these rule-based commands have become even more powerful and integrated into the development workflow.

This guide provides actionable strategies for implementing custom command-like functionality, migrating from legacy systems, and optimizing AI-assisted development workflows in Cursor IDE.

## Key Findings & Insights

### 1. Current State of Slash Commands in Cursor (2025)

#### Native Slash Commands

Cursor provides five built-in slash commands:

- `/Reset Context` - Resets the context to default state
- `/Generate Cursor Rules` - Creates rules for Cursor to follow
- `/Disable Iterate on Lints` - Prevents automatic linter error fixes
- `/Add Open Files to Context` - References all open editor tabs
- `/Add Active Files to Context` - References currently visible tabs

#### Custom Commands: The Reality

- **Discovery behavior (observed)**: Slash commands surface from `.md` files placed under `.cursor/commands/` (e.g., `.cursor/commands/*.md`).
- **Rules vs Commands**: `.mdc` files under `.cursor/rules/` are powerful for shaping agent behavior but do not appear in the slash command picker.
- **No first-class API** yet comparable to Continue IDE, but the above folder convention works reliably in practice.
- **Alternative tools** (Claude Code) offer native command discovery via `.claude/commands/`.

Recommended structure:

```
project/
  .cursor/
    commands/           # Slash commands (Markdown files) → show in picker
      *.md
    rules/              # Behavioral rules (MDC files) → do not show in picker
      *.mdc
```

### 2. The Rules System Evolution

#### Legacy to Modern Transition

```
Old System (Deprecated):
project/
  .cursorrules          # Single file at root

New System (2025):
project/
  .cursor/
    rules/              # Directory-based approach (behavioral rules)
      *.mdc             # Individual rule files (not shown in slash picker)
    index.mdc          # Main configuration
    commands/           # Slash command discovery (observed)
      *.md              # Each file defines a slash command
```

#### MDC File Format

The new `.mdc` format combines:

- **Frontmatter**: Metadata and configuration
- **Content**: Actual rule instructions
- **References**: External file inclusions
- **Scoping**: Directory-based rule inheritance

### 3. Creating Custom Command Functionality (Preferred)

#### The Commands Folder Method (Observed)

1. **Create `.cursor/commands/`**: Place one `.md` per command.
2. **Define a clear trigger**: Start with the slash pattern (e.g., `/s`, `/c`).
3. **Map to actions**: Describe steps/tools the agent should execute.
4. **Leverage context**: Be explicit about inputs and outputs.
5. **Keep it short**: Commands should be concise and focused.

#### Example Implementation

```markdown
---
description: Codebase search shortcut
---

# /s Command

When the user types "/s <term>":

1. Use the codebase_search tool to search for <term> across the repo
2. Show file paths and matching lines
3. Prefer semantic matches; fall back to exact as needed
```

### 4. Community Resources and Ecosystem

#### Major Resources

- **879 converted .mdc files** available from community
- **awesome-cursorrules repository** with extensive examples
- **cursorrules.org** for automated rule generation
- **Active community forums** sharing configurations

#### Migration Tools

- Automated converters from `.cursorrules` to `.mdc`
- LLM-powered rule generation
- Template libraries for common frameworks

## Best Practices & Recommendations

### 1. Organization Strategy (Rules vs Commands)

#### Hierarchical Structure

```
project/
├── .cursor/
│   ├── commands/                 # Slash commands (.md) → show in picker
│   │   ├── search.md
│   │   ├── commit.md
│   │   └── review.md
│   └── rules/                    # Behavior rules (.mdc) → not in picker
│       ├── global.mdc
│       ├── conventions.mdc
│       └── search-behavior.mdc
├── backend/
│   └── .cursor/
│       └── rules/
│           └── api.mdc

```markdown
1. Identify repetitive tasks
2. Map to available Cursor tools
3. Create memorable shortcuts
4. Document in team wiki
5. Share via version control
```

#### Effective Command Patterns

```markdown
## Search Commands

/s <term> - Search codebase
/sf <term> - Search in current file
/sr <pattern> - Regex search

## Generation Commands

/g test - Generate tests for current file
/g docs - Generate documentation
/g types - Generate TypeScript types

```yaml
---
description: Clear, concise description
globs:
  - "**/*.ts"
  - "**/*.tsx"
alwaysApply: false
---

# Rule Content

## Context
Brief explanation of why this rule exists

## Instructions
- Specific, actionable directives
- Use bullet points for clarity
- Reference external files with @filename

## Examples
Show good and bad examples when applicable
```

#### Writing Effective Rules

   - feat|fix|refactor|docs(scope): subject (≤ 72 chars)
3. Include bullets summarizing changes
4. Reference issues if mentioned
```

### Example 3: Test Generation (`.cursor/commands/tests.md`)

```markdown
---
description: Unit test generator
---

# /g test Command

When the user types "/g test":

1. Analyze current file
2. Identify exported functions/components
3. Generate a comprehensive test suite using the project's framework
4. Include edge cases and meaningful test names
```

## Conclusion

While first-class custom slash commands are limited, placing Markdown command files under `.cursor/commands/` reliably surfaces them in the slash picker. Use `.mdc` rules under `.cursor/rules/` to shape agent behavior and scoping, and `.md` commands to expose concise, discoverable actions.

The transition from legacy `.cursorrules` to the modern `.mdc` system represents a significant improvement in flexibility and organization. With 879 community-contributed rule files available and growing ecosystem support, developers have extensive resources to enhance their Cursor IDE experience.

Key success factors include:

1. **Strategic Planning**: Design commands based on actual workflow needs
2. **Incremental Implementation**: Start small and expand based on usage
3. **Team Collaboration**: Share and standardize across development teams
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Refine rules based on real-world usage
5. **Community Engagement**: Leverage and contribute to shared resources

As Cursor continues to evolve, the gap between workarounds and native functionality is likely to close. Until then, the current Rules system provides a robust foundation for creating efficient, customized development workflows.
