 Lets update create-prp.md command to use the  software-architect agent. Make sure and have him   │
│   specifically focus on the gaps mentioned above, but within the context of other information      │
│   available (e.g., typescript, react-native, expo and other items in the research folder).         │
│   ULTRATHINK and think deeply about these changes and create a plan, then execute the plan using   │
│   a subagent you create in the moment temporarily. Create one a subagent based on the              │
│   research/context-engineer.md and research/prompt-context-engineering-claude-code.md (prioritize  │
│   this one) for its role/persona.                                                                  │
