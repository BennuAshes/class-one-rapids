Do you not have access to what the agent was doing? Project files were created, theres an app    │
│   folder with node_modules and a lib folder and its feeling pretty sloppy right now. Don't make    │
│   any changes. I want to have a discussion so I can understand if this was something missing in    │
│   the story, the senior software agent issue, or an issue with solve-story-kanban.md task


Lets update create-prp.md command to use the  software-architect agent. Make sure and have him   │
│   specifically focus on the gaps mentioned above, but within the context of other information      │
│   available (e.g., typescript, react-native, expo and other items in the research folder).         │
│   ULTRATHINK and think deeply about these changes and create a plan, then execute the plan using   │
│   a subagent you create in the moment temporarily. Create one a subagent based on the              │
│   research/context-engineer.md and research/prompt-context-engineering-claude-code.md (prioritize  │
│   this one) for its role/persona.
