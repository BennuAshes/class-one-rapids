# Phase 0: Analysis & Planning

**Duration**: 8 hours  
**Timeline**: Days 1-2  
**Dependencies**: Technical requirements document

## Objectives
- Validate technical requirements and constraints
- Define architecture decisions and trade-offs  
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies
- Create detailed task breakdown and timeline
- Establish development standards and processes

## Tasks Breakdown

### Task 0.1: Requirements Analysis (2 hours)
**Objective**: Deep dive into technical requirements and validate feasibility

#### Validation Steps
1. **Performance Requirements Review**
   ```bash
   # Analyze target performance metrics
   echo "Target: 60 FPS, <50ms input response, <200MB memory"
   echo "Baseline devices: iPhone 8, Samsung Galaxy S8"
   echo "Critical: Test on actual 5-year-old devices, not simulators"
   ```

2. **Technology Stack Validation** 
   - ‚úÖ Expo SDK 52: Latest with New Architecture support
   - ‚úÖ React Native 0.76+: Fabric + TurboModules enabled
   - ‚úÖ Legend State v3 (@beta): Reactive state management
   - ‚úÖ React Native Reanimated 4.0: 60fps animations
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è Verify all packages support New Architecture

3. **Platform Compatibility Check**
   ```bash
   # Check minimum OS versions
   iOS: 12+ (released 2018) - 95%+ market coverage
   Android: API 26+ (2017) - 90%+ market coverage
   Web: Modern browsers with ES2022 support
   ```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] All technical requirements documented and validated
- [ ] Performance targets confirmed achievable on target devices
- [ ] Technology stack compatibility verified
- [ ] Platform support matrix documented

### Task 0.2: Architecture Design (3 hours)
**Objective**: Define application architecture and design patterns

#### Architecture Decisions

1. **State Management Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Legend State v3 with feature-based organization
   src/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/state/         // Global game state
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ departments/state/    // Department-specific state
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ employees/state/      // Employee management state
   ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ prestige/state/       // Prestige system state
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/constants/   // Game configuration
   ```

2. **Component Organization (Vertical Slicing)**
   ```
   src/features/[feature]/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/         // Feature UI components
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/              // Feature-specific logic
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/           // Feature business logic
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/              // Feature state management
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              // Feature type definitions
   ```

3. **Performance Architecture**
   ```typescript
   // Game loop optimization strategy
   - 60fps game loop with requestAnimationFrame
   - Batched state updates with Observable.batch()
   - Memoized calculations with computed values
   - Virtual list rendering for large datasets
   - Aggressive memory management on low-end devices
   ```

#### Architecture Diagrams
```
Game Architecture Flow:

     ‚Üì
[Save System] ‚Üê [Offline Calculations] ‚Üê [Background Processing]
```

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] Component architecture defined and documented
- [ ] State management strategy documented
- [ ] Performance optimization plan created
- [ ] File structure template created

### Task 0.3: Risk Assessment (2 hours)
**Objective**: Identify and plan mitigation for potential project risks

#### Technical Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| New Architecture compatibility issues | Medium | High | Use Expo-compatible packages only, test early |
| Performance on 5-year-old devices | High | Critical | Daily performance testing, optimization checkpoints |
| Legend State v3 beta stability | Medium | Medium | Thorough testing, fallback to stable state solution |
| Memory leaks in idle game loop | Medium | High | Memory profiling at each milestone |
| Build pipeline complexity | Low | Medium | Use EAS Build, avoid custom native modules |

#### Development Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Dependency conflicts | Medium | Medium | Never use --legacy-peer-deps, expo install only |
| Scope creep | High | Medium | Strict MVP focus, change control process |
| Performance regression | Medium | Critical | Automated performance testing in CI |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | Medium | 20% buffer in estimates, daily progress tracking |

#### Success Criteria
- [ ] All technical risks identified and rated
- [ ] Mitigation strategies defined for high-impact risks
- [ ] Risk monitoring plan established
- [ ] Contingency plans documented

### Task 0.4: Development Environment Setup (1 hour)
**Objective**: Define and validate development environment requirements

#### Required Tools
```bash
# Core development tools
node --version    # Must be 18+ LTS
npm --version     # Must be 9+ 
expo --version    # Latest Expo CLI

# Development environment
code --version    # VSCode recommended
git --version     # Version control

    expo_version=$(expo --version)
    echo "Expo CLI: $expo_version"
else
    echo "‚ùå Expo CLI not installed"
    exit 1
fi

# Check for legacy peer deps
if grep -q "legacy-peer-deps" package.json; then
    echo "‚ùå CRITICAL: --legacy-peer-deps detected in package.json!"
    echo "Remove immediately and use 'npx expo install' instead"

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Performance Requirements Too Aggressive
**Symptoms**: 60 FPS target seems unrealistic on 5-year-old devices  
**Solution**: 
- Test on actual devices early
- Implement adaptive performance scaling
- Define performance degradation gracefully

### Issue: Legend State v3 Beta Concerns
**Symptoms**: Team concerned about beta stability  
**Solution**:
- Extensive testing in development
- Fallback plan to Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- Monitor Legend State v3 release timeline

### Issue: New Architecture Compatibility
**Symptoms**: Third-party libraries don't support Fabric/TurboModules  
**Solution**:
- Use Expo SDK modules when possible
- Check React Native Directory for compatibility
- Plan native module alternatives

## Next Steps
After completing Phase 0:
1. **Review Deliverables**: Ensure all documents complete and approved
2. **Team Alignment**: Conduct architecture review meeting
3. **Environment Setup**: All team members set up development environment
4. **Proceed to Phase 1**: Begin foundation setup with approved architecture
