# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Establish a robust React Native foundation for PetSoft Tycoon, an idle/clicker game where players build a software company from garage startup to $1B tech giant. The base setup prioritizes immediate player engagement through responsive interactions, smooth animations at 60fps, and efficient state management using Expo SDK with Legend-State v3 (@beta) for reactive updates and MMKV persistence.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1.1: First Click Response
**User Story:** As a player, I want instant visual and audio feedback when I click the "WRITE CODE" button, so that I feel immediate satisfaction and engagement.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN clicking the main action button THEN visual feedback SHALL occur within 50ms
2. WHEN rapid clicking (10+ clicks/second) THEN all clicks SHALL register without drops
3. IF multiple inputs queue THEN the system SHALL process all inputs in order
4. WHEN numbers increment THEN animations SHALL maintain 60fps smoothness

### Requirement 1.2: Expo Development Environment  
**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured Expo environment with tabs template, so that I can build for iOS, Android, and web without platform-specific issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN running development server THEN the app SHALL launch on iOS Simulator, Android Emulator, and web browser
2. WHEN using Expo Router THEN file-based navigation SHALL work with typed routes
3. IF TypeScript errors exist THEN build SHALL fail with clear error messages
4. WHEN hot reloading THEN changes SHALL reflect within 2 seconds

### Requirement 1.3: Legend-State v3 Integration
**User Story:** As a developer, I want Legend-State v3 (@beta) with MMKV persistence configured, so that game state is reactive and automatically persisted for offline play.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN state changes occur THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
2. WHEN using syncObservable with MMKV plugin THEN state SHALL persist automatically
3. IF app restarts THEN game progress SHALL restore from MMKV storage
4. WHEN accessing nested properties THEN TypeScript SHALL provide full type safety

### Requirement 1.4: Vertical Feature Structure
**User Story:** As a development team, I want features organized in vertical slices, so that each game system (departments, resources, progression) is self-contained and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN creating a new feature THEN it SHALL contain its own components, state, and logic in one folder
2. WHEN features need shared code THEN it SHALL exist in a centralized shared/ directory
3. IF a feature folder has fewer than 9 files THEN structure SHALL remain flat
4. WHEN importing between features THEN dependencies SHALL be explicit and typed

### Requirement 1.5: Game Loop Foundation
**User Story:** As a player, I want departments to produce resources automatically, so that I see continuous progression even when idle.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN game loop runs THEN it SHALL update at consistent 100ms intervals
2. WHEN calculating offline progress THEN it SHALL compute up to 12 hours of advancement
3. IF performance degrades THEN game loop SHALL throttle gracefully
4. WHEN units produce resources THEN calculations SHALL be deterministic

### Requirement 1.6: Visual Feedback System
**User Story:** As a player, I want satisfying visual feedback for all actions, so that I feel the impact of my decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN resources increase THEN number popups SHALL animate with appropriate styling
2. WHEN reaching milestones THEN particle effects SHALL trigger
3. IF multiple animations overlap THEN frame rate SHALL maintain 60fps
4. WHEN UI elements change THEN transitions SHALL use smooth easing curves

## Success Metrics
- First playable interaction within 3 seconds of app launch
- Maintain 60fps during normal gameplay with 100+ animated elements
- State persistence with <100ms save time
- Zero runtime errors in base configuration
- TypeScript coverage at 100% for core systems
- Bundle size under 3MB for initial load

## Out of Scope
- Department-specific game mechanics (beyond basic structure)
- Prestige system implementation
- Audio system integration
- Monetization features
- Cloud save synchronization
- Advanced particle effects
- Platform achievements integration
