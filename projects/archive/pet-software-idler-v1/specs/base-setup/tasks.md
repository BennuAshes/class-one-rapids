## Notes
- **Dependencies**: Expo SDK 51+, @legendapp/state@beta, react-native-mmkv
- **Estimated Timeline**: 3-4 days for complete base setup
- **Risk Factors**: Legend-State v3 beta stability, MMKV platform differences
- **Success Criteria**: Playable game loop with persistent state and smooth performance
