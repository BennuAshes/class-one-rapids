# PetSoft Tycoon: Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

PetSoft Tycoon is an incremental idle game where players build and manage a software company from a single developer to a tech giant. Players progress through seven departments (Development, Sales, Customer Experience, Product, Design, QA, Marketing), each with unique mechanics and upgrade paths. The game features a prestige system called "Investor Rounds" that provides permanent bonuses for long-term progression.

**Key Success Metrics:**
- Target DAU: 10,000+ within 6 months
- 7-day retention: 30%+
- 30-day retention: 15%+
- Average session time: 15+ minutes

## 2. Product Overview

### 2.1 Core Gameplay Loop

The game follows a classic incremental progression pattern:
1. **Click to Generate**: Players start by clicking "WRITE CODE" to generate Lines of Code
2. **Convert Resources**: Lines of Code convert to Features (Basic → Advanced → Premium)
3. **Hire Employees**: Automate production by hiring developers, sales reps, and other specialists
4. **Unlock Departments**: Progressive unlock of 7 specialized departments
5. **Upgrade Systems**: Purchase upgrades to multiply efficiency and unlock new mechanics
6. **Prestige Reset**: Reset progress for permanent bonuses via "Investor Rounds"

### 2.2 Resource Economy

**Primary Resources:**
- Lines of Code (generated by clicking/developers)
- Features (Basic, Advanced, Premium - converted from code)
- Leads (generated by sales department)
- Revenue ($ - generated by combining leads + features)

**Conversion Rates:**
- 10 lines = 1 Basic Feature
- 100 lines = 1 Advanced Feature
- 1,000 lines = 1 Premium Feature
- Revenue = Leads × Features (rates: $50, $500, $5,000)

### 2.3 Progression Curve

**Cost Scaling Formula:** `cost = baseCost × 1.15^owned`
**Major Milestones:**
- $10: First automation (Junior Dev)
- $500: Sales department unlock
- $50K: Manager automation
- $10M: Prestige system
- $1B: Victory condition
