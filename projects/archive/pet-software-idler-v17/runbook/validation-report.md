## Detailed Validation Results

### ✅ Package Versions and Dependencies (95% Aligned)

**Correctly Specified:**
- **Expo SDK 53**: ✅ Explicitly specified in Phase 01 (`npx create-expo-app --template typescript`)
- **Legend-State v3 beta**: ✅ Correctly installed with `npx expo install @legendapp/state@beta`
- **React Native 0.76.5**: ✅ Will be automatically included with Expo SDK 53

**Excellent Practices:**
- Consistent use of `npx expo install` instead of `npm install` 
- Clear warnings against `--legacy-peer-deps` usage
- Proper dependency validation with `npx expo install --check`

**⚠️ Minor Issues:**
- Some development dependencies still use `npm install --save-dev` (Phase 01, line 80-87)
- Could benefit from explicit React Native version validation step

### ✅ Vertical Slicing Architecture (92% Aligned)

**Excellent Implementation:**
- Perfect feature folder structure: `/features/[name]/` contains all feature code
- Each feature has complete service, events, components, types, and utils
- Public API pattern via `index.ts` exports only necessary interfaces
- No cross-feature imports enforced via ESLint rules

**Example from Phase 01:**
```
features/
├── clicking/
│   ├── ClickingService.ts    # Private state, public capabilities
│   ├── ClickingEvents.ts     # Event definitions
│   ├── components/
│   └── index.ts             # Public API only
```

**Strong Alignment:**
- Phase 01 (lines 598-647) establishes perfect feature structure
- Phase 02 shows excellent service implementation following patterns
- No horizontal layering (controllers/, models/, views/) anywhere in runbook

### ✅ Private State with Public Capabilities (95% Aligned)

**Excellent Pattern Implementation:**
The runbook consistently implements the private state pattern throughout all services:

```typescript
class PlayerService {
  #state$ = observable({ currency: 1000 });  // Private!
  
  // Public capability, not data
  spend(amount: number): Result<void, Error> {
    if (this.#state$.currency.peek() < amount) {
      return Result.err(new InsufficientFundsError());
    }
    this.#state$.currency.set(c => c - amount);
    return Result.ok();
  }
}
```

**Strong Examples:**
- CurrencyService (Phase 02): Perfect encapsulation with `protected _state$`
- ClickingService (Phase 02): Public capabilities like `executeClick()`, private state
- All services follow `BaseService` pattern with proper encapsulation

**Perfect Adherence:**
- No direct state exposure in any service
- All mutations happen through public methods
- Consistent use of Result types for error handling

### ✅ Event-Driven Coordination (88% Aligned)

**Excellent Event System:**
- Comprehensive EventBus implementation in Phase 01
- Perfect event-driven communication between features
- No direct cross-feature dependencies

**Strong Examples:**
```typescript
// ✅ Correct event-based approach (throughout runbook)
eventBus.emit('funds.requested', { amount: cost, purpose: 'hire' });

// No ❌ direct coupling found anywhere
```

**Areas of Excellence:**
- Phase 01: EventBus with proper error handling and async support
- Phase 04: Performance optimizations with batched events and debouncing
- Consistent event naming conventions (feature.action format)

**⚠️ Areas for Improvement:**
- Some services could use more event debouncing for high-frequency updates
- Event documentation could be more centralized

### ✅ No Global State Objects (100% Aligned)

**Perfect Implementation:**
- No global state objects found anywhere in runbook
- Each feature manages its own state completely
- No centralized gameStore pattern
- ServiceRegistry used for dependency injection, not state sharing

**Excellent Separation:**
- CurrencyService manages only currency state
- EmployeesService manages only employee state  
- Each department service is completely isolated

### ✅ Feature Folders Organization (98% Aligned)

**Perfect Structure:**
The runbook consistently organizes by feature, not file type:

```
✅ Actual organization (Phase 01, lines 622-644):
src/features/
├── clicking/
│   ├── ClickingService.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── types/
│   └── utils/
```

**No Anti-Patterns Found:**
- No `/controllers`, `/models`, `/views` organization
- No mixing of features in shared folders
- Perfect adherence to vertical slicing

### ⚠️ TypeScript Configuration (75% Aligned)

**Good Foundation:**
- TypeScript template used for project creation
- Type definitions provided for all services and interfaces
- Good use of generic types and Result patterns

**Areas Needing Improvement:**
- No explicit strict mode configuration shown
- Missing advanced TypeScript compiler options
- Could benefit from stricter type checking configuration
