# Story 1.5: UI Foundation System

## User Story
**As a** player, **I want** a polished interface **so that** I can navigate and understand the game easily across all devices.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Clean, intuitive department navigation
- [ ] Responsive design for mobile and tablet
- [ ] Accessibility support for screen readers
- [ ] Consistent visual design system
- [ ] Smooth transitions and animations (60 FPS)
- [ ] Touch targets meet mobile standards (44px minimum)
- [ ] Dark/light theme support

## Technical Design

### Design System Architecture
```typescript
interface DesignSystem {
  colors: ColorPalette;
  typography: TypographyScale;
  spacing: SpacingScale;
  components: ComponentLibrary;
  animations: AnimationPresets;
}

interface ComponentLibrary {
  Button: ButtonVariants;
  Card: CardVariants;
  Counter: CounterVariants;
  Modal: ModalVariants;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Design System
1. Create color palette and theme system
2. Implement typography scale
3. Set up spacing and layout system
4. Create component primitives

### Step 2: Navigation
1. Implement tab-based navigation
2. Create department switching
3. Add modal system
4. Set up screen transitions

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Design System (4 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Create color palette and theme system (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Implement typography and spacing scales (Estimate: 2 hours)

### Phase 2: Component Library (4 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Build button, card, and counter components (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Create modal and navigation components (Estimate: 2 hours)

### Phase 3: Responsive Layout (2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Implement responsive breakpoints and layouts (Estimate: 2 hours)

**Total Estimated Time: 10 hours**

## Dependencies

### Blocks
- **Story 1.6**: Feedback System - requires UI components for effects
- **All Epic 2 Stories**: Department systems need UI foundation

### Blocked by
- **Story 1.1**: Project Architecture Setup - requires component framework

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete design system with consistent theming
- [ ] Responsive layout works on phone and tablet
- [ ] All interactive elements meet accessibility standards
- [ ] Smooth 60 FPS animations throughout interface
