# Story 2.4: Design Department

## User Story
**As a** player, **I want** design team **so that** I can polish products for higher value and better conversion rates.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Design team generates polish points affecting feature value
- [ ] Polish multiplies feature value and conversion rates
- [ ] Four design roles: UI Designer, UX Designer, Design Lead, Creative Director
- [ ] Visual design system unlocks team bonuses at milestones
- [ ] Creative process visualization with design iterations
- [ ] Design-development collaboration bonuses
- [ ] Polish points make features more valuable in sales conversions

## Technical Design

### Design Department Architecture
```typescript
interface DesignDepartment {
  employees: DesignEmployees;
  polishPoints: number;
  designSystemUnlocked: boolean;
  collaborationBonus: number;
}

interface DesignEmployees {
  uiDesigners: { count: number, rate: 1.0, baseCost: 1000 };
  uxDesigners: { count: number, rate: 5.0, baseCost: 10000 };
  designLeads: { count: number, rate: 25, baseCost: 100000 };
  creativeDirectors: { count: number, rate: 100, baseCost: 1000000 };
}
```

## Implementation Plan
1. Implement design department with polish point generation
2. Create design-development collaboration system
3. Add polish effects on feature values and conversion rates
4. Implement design system unlock at 50 designers (2x production)

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Design Foundation (4 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Implement design department with employee types (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Create polish point system and feature value multipliers (Estimate: 2 hours)

### Phase 2: Collaboration (3 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Add design-development collaboration bonuses (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Implement design system unlock and team bonuses (Estimate: 1 hour)

### Phase 3: Polish Effects (3 hours)
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Connect polish to sales conversion improvements (Estimate: 3 hours)

**Total Estimated Time: 10 hours**
