# Story 1.6: Feedback System (Particles & Sound)

## User Story
**As a** player, **I want** satisfying audiovisual feedback **so that** every action feels rewarding and engaging.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Particle effects for all major actions
- [ ] Layered sound design with adaptive mixing
- [ ] Visual feedback hierarchy for different achievements
- [ ] Audio settings for volume control
- [ ] Performance optimization for continuous effects
- [ ] Screen shake for major milestones
- [ ] Visual polish with smooth 60 FPS animations

## Technical Design

### Particle System Architecture
```typescript
interface ParticleSystem {
  emitters: ParticleEmitter[];
  pools: ObjectPool<Particle>[];
  maxParticles: number;
  performance: PerformanceLevel;
}

interface ParticleEmitter {
  id: string;
  position: Vector2;
  velocity: Vector2;
  lifetime: number;
  color: Color;
  size: number;
}
```

### Audio System Design
```typescript
interface AudioSystem {
  sources: AudioSource[];
  mixer: AudioMixer;
  settings: AudioSettings;
  spatialAudio: boolean;
}

interface AudioMixer {
  masterVolume: number;
  sfxVolume: number;
  musicVolume: number;
  compression: boolean;
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Particle System
1. Create object-pooled particle system
2. Implement particle emitters and behaviors
3. Add visual particle types (money, code, stars)
4. Optimize for mobile performance
5. Create particle effect presets

### Step 2: Audio Engine
1. Set up Web Audio API integration
2. Create sound effect library
3. Implement adaptive audio mixing
4. Add spatial audio for immersion
5. Create audio settings interface

### Step 3: Integration & Polish
1. Connect particles to game actions
2. Sync audio with visual effects
3. Add screen shake for major events
4. Implement performance scaling
5. Create effect intensity settings

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Particle System (5 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.1:** Implement object-pooled particle system (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.2:** Create particle emitters and visual effects (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 1.3:** Add particle types and presets for game actions (Estimate: 1 hour)

### Phase 2: Audio System (4 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.1:** Set up Web Audio API with sound library (Estimate: 2 hours)
- [ ] **Task 2.2:** Implement adaptive mixing and spatial audio (Estimate: 2 hours)

### Phase 3: Integration (3 hours)
- [ ] **Task 3.1:** Connect effects to game events and achievements (Estimate: 1.5 hours)
- [ ] **Task 3.2:** Add screen shake and performance optimization (Estimate: 1.5 hours)

**Total Estimated Time: 12 hours**

## Dependencies

### Blocks
- **Story 2.1**: Development Department - requires feedback for department actions
- **Story 4.1**: Achievement System - achievements need celebration effects

### Blocked by
- **Story 1.1**: Project Architecture Setup - requires audio framework
- **Story 1.5**: UI Foundation System - requires UI components for settings

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Particle effects enhance all major game interactions
- [ ] Audio feedback creates satisfying gameplay experience
- [ ] Effects maintain 60 FPS performance on target devices
- [ ] Players can customize audio and visual effect intensity
- [ ] Screen shake celebrates major milestones appropriately
