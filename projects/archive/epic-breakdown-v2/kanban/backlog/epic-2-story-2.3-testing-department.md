# Story 2.3: Testing Department

## User Story
**As a** player, **I want** quality assurance **so that** I can prevent costly bugs and maintain customer satisfaction.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] QA team catches and prevents bugs automatically
- [ ] Bug prevention saves money and reduces support costs
- [ ] Quality multipliers affect customer satisfaction and retention
- [ ] Four QA roles: Tester, QA Engineer, QA Lead, QA Director
- [ ] Testing process visualization with bug catching animations
- [ ] Quality gates unlock team bonuses at milestones
- [ ] QA upgrades: Help Desk Software, Knowledge Base, Customer Success

## Technical Design

### Testing Department Architecture
```typescript
interface TestingDepartment {
  employees: QAEmployees;
  bugsFound: number;
  bugsPrevented: number;
  qualityScore: number;
  costSavings: number;
}

interface QAEmployees {
  testers: { count: number, rate: 0.1, baseCost: 750 };
  engineers: { count: number, rate: 0.5, baseCost: 7500 };
  leads: { count: number, rate: 2.5, baseCost: 75000 };
  directors: { count: number, rate: 10, baseCost: 750000 };
}
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: QA Team Foundation
1. Implement QA department state management
2. Create four QA employee types with bug catching rates
3. Add bug generation and prevention mechanics
4. Implement cost savings calculations

### Step 2: Quality Systems
1. Add quality score calculation and tracking
2. Implement customer satisfaction multipliers
3. Create quality gate bonuses
4. Add bug visualization and animations

### Step 3: QA Upgrades
1. Implement Help Desk Software (+40% ticket resolution)
2. Add Knowledge Base (auto-resolve 25% tickets)
3. Create Customer Success Program (+50% retention impact)
