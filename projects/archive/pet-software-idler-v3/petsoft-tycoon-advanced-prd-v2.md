## Technical Requirements Analysis

### Architecture and Technology Stack

#### **Advanced Performance Monitoring System (REQ-TECH-006)**
Building on the foundational performance requirements, implement comprehensive monitoring:

```typescript
interface PerformanceMonitoringSystem {
  // Real-time performance tracking
  frameTimeMonitor: {
    target: 16.67; // milliseconds (60 FPS)
    warningThreshold: 20;
    criticalThreshold: 33.33; // 30 FPS
    adaptiveQualityAdjustment: boolean;
  };
  
  // Memory usage tracking
  memoryMonitor: {
    maxHeapSize: 50 * 1024 * 1024; // 50MB
    gcTriggerThreshold: 0.8; // 80% of max
    objectPoolingMetrics: ObjectPoolMetrics;
  };
  
  // Device capability detection
  deviceProfiler: {
    cpuBenchmark: number;
    gpuCapability: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
    availableMemory: number;
    recommendedQualityLevel: QualityLevel;
  };
}
```

**Implementation Strategy:**
- **Adaptive Quality System**: Automatically reduce particle density, animation complexity, and update frequencies based on real-time performance metrics
- **Performance Telemetry**: Integrated Flipper monitoring with custom performance metrics for development
- **Production Monitoring**: Lightweight performance tracking that doesn't impact gameplay

#### **Memory Management Architecture (REQ-TECH-007)**
Advanced memory management for scalable gameplay with 1000+ entities:

```typescript
interface MemoryManagementSystem {
  // Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
  objectPools: {
    particles: ObjectPool<Particle>;
    animationFrames: ObjectPool<AnimationFrame>;
    numbers: ObjectPool<FloatingNumber>;
    sounds: ObjectPool<SoundEffect>;
  };
  
  // Entity management for departments and units
  entityManager: {
    departments: Map<string, Department>;
    units: SparseArray<Unit>; // Memory-efficient for large collections
    activeCalculations: WeakMap<Entity, Calculation>;
  };
  
  // Garbage collection optimization
  gcStrategy: {
    batchUpdates: boolean;
    weakReferences: boolean;
    manualGcTriggers: boolean;
  };
}
```

### State Management Strategy

  gameLoop: {
    currentTime: number;
    deltaTime: number;
    isPaused: boolean;
    frameCount: number;
  };
  
  // Core resources - cached computed values
  resources: {
    linesOfCode: number;
    money: number;
    features: number;
    customers: number;
    // Computed values cached for performance
    totalProduction: number; // Cached, updated only when departments change
    globalMultipliers: number; // Cached prestige bonuses
  };
  
  // Department state with computed synergies
  departments: Record<DepartmentType, {
    units: Unit[];
    productionRate: number; // Computed and cached
    synergies: SynergyBonus[]; // Calculated once per change
    uiState: { expanded: boolean; showDetails: boolean; }; // UI state separate from game logic
  }>;
  
  // Meta-game progression
  progression: {
    prestigeLevel: number;
    prestigePoints: number;
    achievements: AchievementState[];
    statistics: GameStatistics;
  };
}
```

  highFrequency: {
    productionCalculations: () => void;
    animationUpdates: () => void;
    uiCounterUpdates: () => void;
  };
  
  // Medium frequency updates (every 100ms)
  mediumFrequency: {
    achievementChecks: () => void;
    synergyRecalculation: () => void;
    saveStateSnapshot: () => void;
  };
  
  // Low frequency updates (every 1s)
