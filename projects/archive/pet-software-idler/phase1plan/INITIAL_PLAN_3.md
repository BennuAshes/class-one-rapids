# Pet Sitting Software Tycoon: MVP Implementation Plan (AI Development Version)

*Generated: July 28, 2025*  
*Purpose: Experimental project developed by AI agents*

## Executive Summary

This plan outlines the development of "Pet Sitting Software Tycoon" - an idle/clicker game where players manage a software company specializing in pet sitting solutions. The game will be developed experimentally by AI agents to explore AI collaboration patterns while creating a fun, playable game.

**Game Objectives (unchanged from design doc):**
- **Primary Goal:** Increase Delight Score (✨) through customer satisfaction
- **Core Loop:** Income generation → Development automation → Feature releases → Customer satisfaction management
- **MVP Scope:** Essential mechanics with 2-3 foundational features

**Development Objectives (AI-specific):**
- Validate AI agent collaboration patterns
- Create clean, modular architecture
- Learn effective coordination strategies
- Build a genuinely fun game

## PART A: GAME IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## 1. Technology Stack

### Validated for Both Game Requirements and AI Development

- **Expo + React Native**: Cross-platform mobile game development
- **TypeScript**: Type safety essential for game state and AI collaboration
- **Legend State v3**: Reactive state perfect for idle game mechanics
- **TanStack Query v5**: Ready for future features (leaderboards, cloud saves)
- **React Native Reanimated**: Smooth animations for satisfying gameplay

### Additional Game-Specific Libraries:
- **expo-haptics**: Tactile feedback for clicks
- **react-native-svg**: For progress bars and visual elements
- **expo-notifications**: For re-engagement features

---

## 2. Game Architecture (Per Design Document)

### Core Game Systems

```typescript
// Game systems as specified in design doc
interface GameSystems {
  // Player Resources
  moneySystem: {
    currentMoney: number;
    clickValue: number;
    passiveIncome: number;
  };
  
  // Development System (in-game developers, not AI)
  developmentSystem: {
    developmentPoints: number;
    juniorDevelopers: number; // In-game NPCs
    dpPerSecond: number;
  };
  
  // Customer System
  customerSystem: {
    customerBase: number;
    satisfaction: number; // 0-100%
    revenuePerCustomer: number;
  };
  
  // Feature System (pet sitting software features)
  featureSystem: {
    availableFeatures: Feature[];
    unlockedFeatures: string[];
    activeFeatures: string[];
  };
  
  // Delight System
  delightSystem: {
    currentScore: number;
    delightEvents: DelightEvent[];
    nextMilestone: number;
  };
}
```

### MVP Features (From Design Doc)
1. **Basic Scheduling** - Core pet sitting appointment system
2. **Simple Client Portal** - Basic customer interface  
3. **Payment Processing** - Transaction handling system (if time permits)

---

## 3. Game Implementation Details

### 3.1 Income Generation Mechanics
- **Manual Clicking**: Start with $1 per click
- **Passive Income**: From hired junior developers and customer base
- **Offline Progress**: Calculate income while app is closed (capped at 8 hours)

### 3.2 Development Point System
- **Manual Generation**: "Code Feature" button for active DP generation
- **Junior Developers**: NPCs that generate passive DP
- **Usage**: Spend DP to research features and fix bugs

### 3.3 Customer Satisfaction Loop
- **Natural Decay**: Satisfaction decreases over time without new features
- **Feature Releases**: Boost satisfaction when releasing new features
- **Customer Growth**: Higher satisfaction = faster customer base growth
- **Revenue Impact**: More customers = more passive income

### 3.4 Delight Events (MVP)
1. **First Feature Release**: Minor delight boost
2. **Consistent High Satisfaction**: Maintain 90%+ for sustained period
3. **All Features Unlocked**: Major delight boost for completing MVP features

## 4. User Interface Design

### 4.1 Screen Layout
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│      Pet Sitting            │
│    Software Tycoon          │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  💰 Money: $1,234           │
│  💻 DP: 56                  │
│  😊 Satisfaction: 85%       │
│  ✨ Delight: 42             │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│                             │
│   [Generate Income!]        │
│       (+$10)                │
│                             │
├─────────────────────────────┤

└─────────────────────────────┘
```

### 4.2 Visual Polish
- Satisfying animations for money/DP generation
- Progress bars for feature development
- Celebration effects for delight events
- Number formatting (1.5K, 2.3M, etc.)

## 5. Game Balance Configuration

```typescript
const GAME_BALANCE = {
  // Starting values
  startingMoney: 0,
  startingCustomers: 0,
  startingSatisfaction: 100,
  
  // Income mechanics
  baseClickValue: 1,
  clickUpgradeMultiplier: 1.5,
  passiveIncomePerCustomer: 0.01,
  
  // Development mechanics  
  baseDPPerClick: 1,
  juniorDevDPPerSecond: 0.5,
  juniorDevBaseCost: 100,
  juniorDevCostMultiplier: 1.5,
  
  // Feature costs (MVP features)
  features: {
    basicScheduling: {
      dpCost: 50,
      moneyCost: 100,
      satisfactionBoost: 20,
      description: "Let pet sitters manage appointments"
    },
    simpleClientPortal: {
      dpCost: 150,
      moneyCost: 500,
      satisfactionBoost: 25,
      description: "Clients can book services online"
    }
  },
  
  // Satisfaction mechanics
  satisfactionDecayRate: 0.001, // Per second
  maxSatisfaction: 100,
  minSatisfaction: 0,
  
  // Customer growth
  customerGrowthRateAt100Satisfaction: 0.1, // Per second
  customerGrowthRateAt0Satisfaction: -0.05 // Customers leave!
};
```

## PART B: AI DEVELOPMENT APPROACH

## 6. Development Methodology for AI Agents

### 6.1 Clear Specification Format
Each game system needs explicit specifications for AI implementation:

```typescript
// Example specification for AI agents to implement
interface IncomeSystemSpecification {
  purpose: "Handle all money generation in the game";
  
  requirements: {
    userActions: ["Click button to generate money"];
    passiveGeneration: ["Calculate money from customers", "Apply developer bonuses"];
    persistence: ["Save current money", "Calculate offline earnings"];
  };
  
  inputs: {
    clickEvent: "User taps generate income button";
    timeDelta: "Seconds since last update";
    gameState: "Current money, customers, multipliers";
  };
  
  outputs: {
    newMoneyAmount: "Updated money after calculations";
    floatingText: "+$X animation on screen";
    soundEffect: "Play satisfying coin sound";
  };
  
  validation: {
    "Money never negative": "money >= 0",
    "Money increases on click": "newMoney > oldMoney after click",
    "Offline cap works": "offlineEarnings <= 8 hours of income"
  };
}
```

  test('Income system updates game state correctly', () => {
    const gameState = createInitialGameState();
    const incomeSystem = new IncomeSystem(gameState);
    
    incomeSystem.handleClick();
    
    expect(gameState.money).toBe(1);
    expect(gameState.stats.totalClicks).toBe(1);
  });
  
  test('Feature unlock affects customer satisfaction', () => {
    const gameState = createGameStateWithResources();
    const featureSystem = new FeatureSystem(gameState);
    
    featureSystem.unlockFeature('basicScheduling');
    
    expect(gameState.satisfaction).toBeGreaterThan(100);
    expect(gameState.unlockedFeatures).toContain('basicScheduling');
