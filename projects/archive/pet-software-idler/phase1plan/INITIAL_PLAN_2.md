# Pet Sitting Software Tycoon: AI-Driven Experimental MVP Plan

*Generated: July 28, 2025*  
*Purpose: Experimental AI agent collaboration project*

## Executive Summary

This revised plan adapts the Pet Sitting Software Tycoon MVP for development entirely by AI agents as an experimental learning project. The focus shifts from market validation to technical exploration and AI collaboration effectiveness.

**Experimental Goals:**
- Validate AI agent collaboration patterns
- Explore innovative gameplay mechanics without market constraints
- Create clean, modular architecture through AI development
- Learn effective AI agent coordination strategies

## 1. Technology Stack (Validated for AI Development)

### Core Technologies Remain Unchanged
The original technology choices are well-suited for AI development:

- **Expo + React Native**: Zero configuration, cross-platform
- **TypeScript**: Essential for AI agents - type safety and self-documenting code
- **Legend State v3**: Simple API, reactive programming perfect for AI understanding
- **TanStack Query v5**: Clear patterns for data fetching (future expansion ready)
- **SOLID Architecture**: Natural fit for modular AI development

### Why These Technologies Work for AI:
1. **Strong typing** prevents integration errors between agents
2. **Reactive state** reduces coordination complexity
3. **Modular patterns** enable parallel development
4. **Clear abstractions** facilitate AI understanding

---

## 2. AI Agent Task Distribution

### Module Ownership Model
Each AI agent owns specific, well-bounded modules with clear interfaces:

```typescript
// Example: Clear module ownership and interfaces
interface ModuleOwnership {
  incomeGeneration: {
    owner: "senior-software-engineer",
    interfaces: ["IIncomeGenerator", "IClickHandler", "IPassiveIncome"],
    dependencies: ["game-state", "constants"]
  },
  featureSystem: {
    owner: "software-architect",
    interfaces: ["IFeature", "IFeatureManager", "IFeatureUnlock"],
    dependencies: ["game-state", "income-generation"]
  },
  customerSatisfaction: {
    owner: "senior-software-engineer",
    interfaces: ["ICustomerManager", "ISatisfactionCalculator"],
    dependencies: ["feature-system", "game-state"]
  },
  gameState: {
    owner: "software-architect",
    interfaces: ["IGameState", "IStatePersistence", "IStateObservable"],
    dependencies: []
  },
  ui: {
    owner: "senior-software-engineer",
    interfaces: ["IGameScreen", "IComponent", "ITheme"],
    dependencies: ["game-state", "all-game-systems"]
  },
  testing: {
    owner: "qa-engineer",
    interfaces: ["ITestSuite", "IIntegrationTest"],
    dependencies: ["all-modules"]
  }
}
```

---

## 3. Explicit Interface Contracts

### Every Module Must Define Clear Contracts

```typescript
// contracts/income-generation.contract.ts
export interface IncomeGenerationContract {
  // Input specifications
  inputs: {
    currentMoney: number; // Current money amount (>=0)
    clickMultiplier: number; // Click value multiplier (>=1)
    passiveIncomeRate: number; // Income per second (>=0)
    lastUpdateTime: number; // Unix timestamp of last update
  };
  
  // Output specifications
  outputs: {
    updatedMoney: number; // New money amount after calculation
    incomeGenerated: number; // Amount of income generated
    nextUpdateTime: number; // Unix timestamp for next update
  };
  
  // Behavior specifications
  behaviors: {
    onClick: {
      description: "Generates income from manual click",
      formula: "currentMoney + (baseClickValue * clickMultiplier)",
      validation: ["updatedMoney >= currentMoney", "incomeGenerated > 0"]
    },
    onUpdate: {
      description: "Calculates passive income since last update",
      formula: "currentMoney + (passiveIncomeRate * secondsElapsed)",
      validation: ["handles offline time", "caps at maxOfflineHours"]
    }
  };
  
  // Test requirements
  testRequirements: {
    unitTests: ["onClick", "onUpdate", "offlineCalculation"],
    integrationTests: ["withGameState", "withPersistence"],
    edgeCases: ["negative values", "overflow", "time manipulation"]
  };
}
```

## 9. Documentation Requirements for AI Agents

### Every Module Must Include:

```typescript
/**
 * Income Generation Module
 * 
 * @module IncomeGeneration
 * @owner senior-software-engineer
 * 
 * @description
 * Handles all income generation mechanics including manual clicks
 * and passive income from developers and customers.
 * 
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const income = new IncomeGenerator(gameState);
 * const generated = income.handleClick();
 * console.log(`Generated ${generated} money`);
 * ```
 * 
 * @integration
 * - Reads: gameState.resources.money
 * - Writes: gameState.resources.money
 * - Events: 'income:generated', 'income:offline-calculated'
 */
```
