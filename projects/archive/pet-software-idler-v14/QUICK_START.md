# Pet Software Idler v13 - Quick Start

## Project Overview
This is version 13 of the Pet Software Idler project, initialized from design-doc.md. This version represents a new iteration building upon version 12.

## Current Status
- **Version**: v13
- **Created**: 2025-08-11T18:00:51Z
- **Previous Version**: v12
- **Workflow Stage**: initialized

## Available Artifacts
- ✅ **design-doc.md** - Core design document (copied from parent directory)
- ❌ **PRD** - Product Requirements Document (not yet created)
- ❌ **Technical Requirements** - Technical specifications (not yet created)  
- ❌ **Runbook** - Implementation runbook (not yet created)

## Project Flags
- **from_design_doc**: true - Project initialized from existing design document
- **skip_archive**: false - Archive previous versions as needed
- **clean_start**: false - Building upon previous version

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review the design-doc.md to understand project requirements
2. Generate PRD (Product Requirements Document) based on design document
3. Create technical requirements specification
4. Build implementation runbook with detailed steps

### Development Workflow
1. **Analysis Phase**: Review design document and previous version artifacts
2. **Planning Phase**: Create PRD and technical requirements
3. **Implementation Phase**: Follow runbook for systematic development
4. **Quality Phase**: Testing, validation, and refinement
5. **Deployment Phase**: Final preparation and launch
