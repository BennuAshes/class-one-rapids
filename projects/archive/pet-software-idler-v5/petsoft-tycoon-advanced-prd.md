As a player starting the game, I want to click a button to write code so that I can immediately begin producing resources and understand the core mechanic.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I am on the game screen, when I click the "WRITE CODE" button, then I gain +1 Line of Code with visual and audio feedback
- Given I have clicked 5 times, when the counter updates, then a "Hire Junior Dev $10" button appears
- Given I have sufficient money, when I purchase a Junior Dev, then automatic code production begins at 0.1 lines/second

As a player with code, I want to convert lines of code into features so that I can generate revenue and progress toward business growth.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have 10+ lines of code, when I click "Ship Feature", then 10 lines convert to 1 Basic Feature and I earn $15
- Given I complete a feature conversion, when the transaction processes, then money counter appears with cash register sound
- Given I have money, when feature conversion completes, then upgrade options become available

**US-003: Department Automation**  
As a player managing multiple resources, I want to hire managers to automate departments so that I can focus on strategic decisions rather than repetitive clicking.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I reach $50,000 total earnings, when the milestone triggers, then manager automation unlocks for all departments

As a player building a sustainable business, I want to invest in customer support so that I can increase customer retention and multiply long-term revenue.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have active customers, when I hire Support Agents, then they resolve tickets and increase retention multiplier
- Given improved retention, when customers make repeat purchases, then I receive increased revenue per transaction
- Given high customer satisfaction, when retention bonuses apply, then revenue multiplier increases from 1.1x up to 3x

**US-006: Department Synergies**  
As a strategic player, I want departments to work together and create multiplier effects so that optimal resource allocation becomes a meaningful strategic decision.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have multiple departments active, when certain thresholds are reached, then cross-department bonuses activate
- Given I reach 25 units in a department, when the milestone triggers, then a 2x efficiency multiplier applies
- Given I reach 50 units in a department, when the second milestone triggers, then additional specialized bonuses unlock

### Epic 3: Progression and Prestige (MVP Extended)

**US-007: Prestige System Implementation**  
As a player reaching mid-game limits, I want to reset my progress for permanent bonuses so that I can break through progression barriers and achieve exponentially higher goals.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I reach $10 million valuation, when prestige becomes available, then "Investor Round" option appears with clear benefit explanation
- Given I choose to prestige, when the reset processes, then I receive Investor Points based on my valuation (1 IP per $1M)

**US-008: Achievement System**  
As a player seeking goals and recognition, I want to unlock achievements for significant milestones so that I have clear progression targets and feel rewarded for exploration.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I complete notable actions, when achievement conditions are met, then achievement notifications appear with celebration effects
- Given I unlock achievements, when I view my progress, then I can see both completed and upcoming achievement targets
- Given achievements provide bonuses, when they unlock, then gameplay benefits apply immediately and visibly

### Epic 4: Polish and User Experience (MVP Quality)

**US-009: Visual and Audio Feedback**  
As a player taking actions in the game, I want immediate and satisfying feedback so that every interaction feels responsive and rewarding.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

- Given I reach significant milestones, when they trigger, then appropriate particle effects and screen animations play
- Given audio is enabled, when actions occur, then contextual sounds play with appropriate volume balancing

**US-010: Save System and Offline Progression**  
As a player with limited continuous play time, I want my progress to save automatically and continue while offline so that I can make meaningful progress even with irregular play sessions.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I'm playing the game, when 30 seconds pass, then progress automatically saves to local storage
- Given I close the game and return, when the game loads, then offline progression is calculated for up to 12 hours
- Given offline time exceeds 12 hours, when I return, then I receive the maximum 12-hour benefit with notification of the time cap
