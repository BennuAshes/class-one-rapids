# Architecture Decision Record: PetSoft Tycoon Technology Stack

## Status
**DECIDED** - 2025-08-07

## Decision Maker
Senior Software Engineer

## Context and Problem Statement

The PetSoft Tycoon PRD specifies vanilla JavaScript for web deployment, but the development context suggests React Native/Expo mobile application development. We need to choose a technology stack that:

1. Achieves 60 FPS performance requirements
2. Enables 4-week development timeline
3. Supports comprehensive testing (90% coverage target)
4. Aligns with research-validated architectural patterns
5. Provides superior development velocity and maintainability

## Decision Drivers

### Performance Requirements
- 60 FPS gameplay on Intel HD Graphics 4000 equivalent
- <50ms response time for all interactions
- <3MB initial bundle size
- <50MB memory usage during gameplay

### Development Requirements
- 4-week development + 1 week polish timeline
- Feature-based architecture (vertical slicing)
- Comprehensive testing with user-centric approach
- Legend State v3 for reactive state management

### Team and Quality Requirements
- TypeScript-first development
- Superior debugging and development tools
- Cross-platform expansion capability
- Maintainable, scalable codebase

## Options Considered

### Option 1: Vanilla JavaScript (PRD Original Specification)
**Pros:**
- Matches original PRD specification
- Maximum performance potential
- Minimal framework overhead

**Cons:**
- Slower development velocity
- Custom testing infrastructure required
- Limited scalability and maintainability
- No built-in TypeScript integration
- Manual implementation of reactive patterns

### Option 2: React + Legend State (Web-First)
**Pros:**
- Fast development with React ecosystem
- Excellent Legend State integration
- Comprehensive testing tools
- Strong TypeScript support

**Cons:**
- Web-only deployment
- No native mobile expansion path
- Requires separate mobile development later

### Option 3: React Native/Expo + Legend State (SELECTED)
**Pros:**
- Cross-platform (web + mobile) from single codebase
- Fastest development velocity with Expo tooling
- Native performance with 60 FPS capability
- Excellent testing ecosystem (React Native Testing Library)
- Superior debugging tools and development experience
- Built-in TypeScript support
- Perfect Legend State integration
- Feature-based architecture support
- Future-proof for mobile expansion

**Cons:**
- Slightly larger initial bundle than vanilla JS
- Framework learning curve (minimal with React knowledge)

## Decision

**Selected: React Native/Expo with TypeScript + Legend State**

## Technical Implementation Stack

### Core Framework
- **React Native 0.76+** with New Architecture enabled
- **Expo SDK 52+** for development tooling and web deployment
- **TypeScript 5.0+** in strict mode
- **Metro bundler** with optimization for production builds

### State Management
- **Legend State v3** for reactive state management
- **Modular observable patterns** aligned with feature-based architecture
- **Computed observables** for derived game calculations
- **Batch updates** for performance optimization

### Development Tools
- **React Native Testing Library** for user-centric testing
- **Jest** for test runner and assertions
- **ESLint** with React Native and accessibility rules
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Expo CLI** for development and deployment

### Performance Optimization
- **Hermes JavaScript engine** for optimized performance
- **React Native New Architecture** (Fabric + TurboModules + JSI)
- **Bundle splitting** for optimal loading
- **Performance monitoring** with React DevTools Profiler

## Rationale

### Performance Validation
React Native with the New Architecture can achieve our 60 FPS target:
- Hermes engine provides optimized JavaScript performance
- Fabric renderer eliminates bridge bottlenecks
- JSI enables synchronous native communication
- Benchmarks show React Native apps achieving 60 FPS in production

### Development Velocity
Expo + React Native provides fastest path to production:
- Instant development server with hot reloading
- Comprehensive debugging tools
- Built-in testing infrastructure
- Extensive ecosystem of pre-built components

### Future-Proofing
Single codebase deployment options:
- **Web:** Expo Web for browser deployment
- **iOS:** Native iOS app through Expo Build Service
- **Android:** Native Android app through Expo Build Service
- **Desktop:** Electron integration possible

### Research Alignment
Perfect match with research requirements:
- Feature-based directory structure supported
- Custom hooks over utilities pattern
- Component co-location patterns
- Legend State modular observable patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- ✅ 60 FPS performance achievable with React Native New Architecture
- ✅ 4-week timeline achievable with Expo development velocity
- ✅ 90% test coverage achievable with React Native Testing Library
- ✅ Cross-platform deployment from single codebase
- ✅ Superior debugging and development experience
- ✅ Perfect alignment with all research patterns
- ✅ Future-proof architecture for team scaling

### Negative
- ⚠️ Slightly larger bundle than vanilla JS (mitigated by optimization)
- ⚠️ Framework dependency (mitigated by React Native's maturity)
- ⚠️ Learning curve for React Native specific patterns (minimal)

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Bundle Size:** Aggressive code splitting and tree shaking
- **Performance:** Use React Native New Architecture optimizations
- **Learning:** Comprehensive documentation and research alignment

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup
1. Initialize Expo project with TypeScript
2. Configure development tools (ESLint, Prettier, Testing)
3. Setup feature-based directory structure
4. Install and configure Legend State v3

### Phase 2: Performance Foundation
1. Configure Metro bundler for optimization
2. Setup performance monitoring
3. Implement game loop with 60 FPS target
4. Configure Hermes engine optimizations

### Phase 3: Development Infrastructure
1. Setup testing framework with high coverage targets
2. Configure CI/CD pipeline
3. Setup code quality gates
4. Implement development workflow

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Project builds and runs with Expo
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode passes
- [ ] All linting and formatting rules pass
- [ ] Testing framework operational
- [ ] Development server starts in <10 seconds
- [ ] Hot reloading works effectively
- [ ] Performance monitoring active

## Review and Updates

This ADR will be reviewed after Phase 1 Foundation completion to validate the decision meets all requirements. Updates will be tracked with version numbers and dates.
