## Phase Dependencies

```
Foundation → Core Features → Integration → Quality → Deployment
     ↓            ↓             ↓           ↓
State Mgmt → Game Logic → Synergies → Testing → Monitoring
Performance → Save/Load → Prestige → Polish → Security
```

### Critical Path
1. **Architecture Decision** (Foundation) → All subsequent phases
2. **State Management** (Foundation) → Core Features → Integration
3. **Performance Framework** (Foundation) → Quality → Deployment
4. **Testing Setup** (Foundation) → Quality validation throughout

### Parallel Work Opportunities
- **Foundation + Core:** State management can be developed while UI components are built
- **Integration + Quality:** Testing can begin as features are integrated
- **Quality + Deployment:** Build optimization can occur during final testing phases

## Progress Tracking

Use the provided progress tracking script to monitor implementation:

```bash
# Track overall completion
./runbook-progress.sh

# Track specific phase
./runbook-progress.sh --phase 2

# Generate status report
./runbook-progress.sh --report
```

### Progress Tracking Data
The runbook includes a `progress.json` file for tracking task completion:

```json
{
  "phases": {
    "foundation": { "completed": 0, "total": 15, "status": "pending" },
    "core-features": { "completed": 0, "total": 22, "status": "pending" },
    "integration": { "completed": 0, "total": 12, "status": "pending" },
    "quality": { "completed": 0, "total": 14, "status": "pending" },
    "deployment": { "completed": 0, "total": 8, "status": "pending" }
  },
  "totalTasks": 71,
  "completedTasks": 0,
  "lastUpdated": "2025-08-07"
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### Architecture Requirements
- **Feature-Based Organization:** All code organized by feature, not by technical layer
- **Reactive State Management:** Legend State for fine-grained reactivity
- **Performance-First:** 60 FPS target with <50ms response times
- **Testing-Centric:** 90% code coverage with user-focused testing

### Development Standards
- **TypeScript:** Strict mode with comprehensive type coverage
- **Testing:** User-centric testing with React Testing Library patterns
- **Performance:** Continuous monitoring with automated regression detection
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 AA compliance throughout development

### Quality Gates
Each phase includes validation checklists that must be completed before proceeding:
- ✅ Technical requirements met
- ✅ Performance targets achieved
- ✅ Tests passing with required coverage
- ✅ Code quality standards maintained

---

## Resource Requirements

### Team Skills Required
- **Frontend Development:** React/React Native, TypeScript, Legend State
- **Game Development:** Idle game mechanics, progression systems
- **Testing:** React Testing Library, E2E testing, performance testing
- **DevOps:** CI/CD, monitoring, deployment automation

### Key Dependencies
- **Core Framework:** React Native/Expo or React (architecture decision pending)
- **State Management:** Legend State v3
- **Testing:** React Testing Library, Jest, Maestro
- **Performance:** Web Audio API, performance monitoring utilities
- **Build:** Vite/Metro, bundle optimization tools

---

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Architecture Decision:** Technology stack choice affects entire project
2. **Performance:** 60 FPS requirement with complex calculations
3. **Offline Progression:** Accurate time-based calculations
4. **Save Data Integrity:** Protecting player progress

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Early Decision Making:** Resolve architecture questions in Foundation phase
- **Performance Budgets:** Continuous monitoring with automated alerts
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Automated testing for all critical calculations
- **Data Protection:** Multiple save systems with integrity validation
