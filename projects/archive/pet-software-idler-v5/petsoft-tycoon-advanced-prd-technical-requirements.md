## MANDATORY IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS

### Research-Based Implementation Requirements

Based on comprehensive technical research synthesis, implementations MUST adhere to the following constraints:

**Feature-Based Architecture (research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84):**
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── codeProduction/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── services/
│   │   └── types/
│   ├── departmentManagement/
│   ├── prestigeSystem/
│   └── achievements/
```

**State Management Patterns (research/tech/legend-state.md:388-417):**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Modular Legend State patterns
const codeProductionState$ = observable({
  linesOfCode: 0,
  productionRate: 0,
  actions: {
    writeCode: () => codeProductionState$.linesOfCode.set(c => c + 1),
    calculateRate: () => {
      // Computed observable pattern
      return codeProductionState$.employees.get() * baseRate;
    }
  }
});
```

**Custom Hooks Over Utilities (research/tech/react-native.md:1589-1614):**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Custom hooks pattern for game logic
const useCodeProduction = () => {
  const linesOfCode = use$(codeProductionState$.linesOfCode);
  const writeCode = useCallback(() => {
    codeProductionState$.actions.writeCode();
  }, []);
  
  return { linesOfCode, writeCode };
};
```

**Component Organization (research/tech/react-native.md:1656-1673):**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: Component co-location with related assets
src/features/codeProduction/components/WriteCodeButton/
├── WriteCodeButton.tsx
├── WriteCodeButton.test.tsx  
├── WriteCodeButton.styles.ts
├── index.ts
└── types.ts
```

**Testing Strategy Implementation (research/tech/test/react-native-testing-library-best-practices-2025.md):**
```typescript
// REQUIRED: User-centric testing approach
describe('WriteCodeButton', () => {
  it('should increase lines of code when clicked', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    render(<WriteCodeButton />);
    
    const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /write code/i });
    await user.click(button);
    
    expect(screen.getByText(/lines of code: 1/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Architecture Deviation Halt Points

**CRITICAL: Any deviation from the following patterns should HALT implementation:**

1. **Non-Feature-Based Architecture:** Using traditional MVC or component-only organization
2. **Utility-First Patterns:** Creating utility functions instead of custom hooks for game logic  
3. **Non-Reactive State Management:** Using Redux patterns or non-reactive state approaches
4. **Implementation-Detail Testing:** Testing internal state instead of user behavior

### Technology Stack Validation Matrix

| Requirement | Current Spec | Recommended | React Native Alternative |
|------------|-------------|------------|------------------------|
| **Performance** | Vanilla JS | React + Legend State | React Native + Legend State |
| **Bundle Size** | <3MB | ✅ Achievable | ✅ Achievable with optimization |
| **Development Speed** | Medium | ✅ High | ✅ Very High |
| **Testing Quality** | Custom | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Comprehensive |
| **Cross-Platform** | Web Only | Web Only | ✅ Web + Mobile |
| **Team Scalability** | Limited | ✅ High | ✅ Very High |
