## Technical Architecture Notes for AI Agents

### File Structure
```
/projects/pet-sitting/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html          # Main game interface
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css          # All styling
â”œâ”€â”€ game.js            # Core game logic
â”œâ”€â”€ utils.js           # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ constants.js       # Game configuration
```

### Key Systems to Implement
1. **Game Loop**: Single requestAnimationFrame loop for all updates
2. **Persistence**: Centralized save/load system
3. **Event System**: For achievements and notifications
4. **State Management**: Single source of truth object

### Testing Approach
- Each story should have console.log statements for debugging
- Implement developer console commands for testing (e.g., addMoney(1000))
- Save state snapshots for regression testing

### Performance Constraints
- Target 60 FPS for animations
- Limit DOM updates to changed values only
- Batch localStorage writes (max once per second)
- Support browsers from last 2 years
