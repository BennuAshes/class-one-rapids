# Pet Software Idler - Design Document v3
## Building the Purrfect Software Company

### Executive Summary
Pet Software Idler is a meticulously polished idle game where players build a software company that creates solutions for pet sitting businesses. Every click writes code that helps pet sitters care for adorable animals. By focusing on proven idle mechanics executed with exceptional attention to detail, we create an experience where the joy of helping pets and their caretakers shines through every interaction. This isn't about innovation - it's about crafting the most satisfying pet software company simulator possible.

### Core Design Philosophy
"Every line of code you write helps a pet sitter care for a furry friend. Every feature you ship makes a tail wag somewhere. Every customer you delight means happier pets and happier pet parents. We're not just building software - we're building a better world for pets, one perfectly polished click at a time."

   - Particle effect: Paw prints float up with +1 Lines of Code
   - Pet reaction: Random pet avatar shows happy animation in corner

2. **BUILD FEATURES** (5-10s) ‚Üí Watch your software grow
   - Features bar fills up showing "Building: Pet Scheduling System"
   - Happy pet animations play as features near completion
   - Customer satisfaction meter shows pet sitters getting happier
   - Background shows scrolling testimonials from pet sitting businesses

3. **SHIP TO CUSTOMERS** (2-3s) ‚Üí Deploy to pet sitters
