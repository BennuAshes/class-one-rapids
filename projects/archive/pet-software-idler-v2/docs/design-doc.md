Pet Sitting Software Tycoon: MVP Design Document
1. Core Concept:
"Pet Sitting Software Tycoon" is an idle/clicker game where players manage and grow a software company specializing in solutions for pet sitting businesses. The core loop focuses on generating money to develop features and satisfy customers, ultimately aiming to "Surprise and Delight the Customer."

2. Goal of the Game:
The ultimate goal is to increase the Delight Score (✨), which serves as the primary progression metric. Financial success enables investments that contribute to this score.

3. Key Resources/Stats (Simplified):

Money ($): Primary currency.

Customer Base (Users): Number of subscribers, increases revenue.

Customer Satisfaction (%): How happy customers are. Impacts revenue and Delight Score.

Delight Score (✨): Core long-term progression. Increased by Delight Events.

Development Points (DP): Generated by developers, used for features.

4. Core Gameplay Loop (Streamlined):

Click for Basic Income: Players start by clicking to generate initial money.

Invest in Automation: Purchase upgrades and hire Junior Developers to automate DP generation and passive income.

Develop Features: Use Development Points and Money to research and release new, basic software features (e.g., "Basic Scheduling," "Simple Client Portal"). New features increase potential revenue and Customer Satisfaction.

Manage Customer Satisfaction: Customer Satisfaction will naturally decrease over time if new features aren't released. Releasing features boosts it.

Grow Customer Base: Customer Base will grow passively based on Customer Satisfaction. Higher satisfaction leads to faster growth.

Trigger Delight Events: Achieving consistently high Customer Satisfaction and releasing specific key features will trigger simple "Delight Events," boosting the Delight Score.

Repeat: Continuously develop, grow, and delight to reach higher Delight Scores.

MVP Specifics
5. Company Aspects & Mechanics (MVP Focus):

5.1. Development (Core Loop)
Mechanic: Generates Development Points (DP) over time. Initially, DP can also be generated by active clicking on a "Code Feature" button.

Actions:

Research New Feature: Spend DP and Money to unlock a limited set of 2-3 foundational software modules. Each feature provides a base revenue increase and a Customer Satisfaction boost.

Fix Bug (Simplified): Instead of individual bugs, a "Bug Risk" meter might appear, increasing with rapid feature development. Clicking "Fix Bug" (spending DP) resets it and prevents large Satisfaction drops.

Employee: Only Junior Developers are available to hire, increasing passive DP generation.

5.2. Customer Satisfaction (Directly Tied to Development)
Mechanic: A percentage reflecting customer happiness.

How it works:

Increases when new features are released.

Decreases gradually over time if no new features are released or if "Bug Risk" is ignored.

Directly impacts passive Customer Base growth and recurring revenue.

5.3. Operations (Essential Upgrades)
Mechanic: Provides overall efficiency.

Actions:

Upgrade Servers: Spend Money to increase overall DP generation rates and passive income. This is the only "Operations" upgrade for MVP.

6. "Surprise & Delight" Mechanic (MVP Version):

The Delight Score is the core progression.

It increases primarily through Delight Events.

MVP Delight Events:

Consistent High Satisfaction: Reaching and maintaining 90%+ Customer Satisfaction for a sustained period triggers a small Delight boost.

First Feature Release: Releasing the first new software feature (beyond the initial "basic" product) triggers a minor Delight boost.

Unlock All MVP Features: Unlocking the 2-3 foundational features available in the MVP triggers a significant Delight boost.

7. Progression & Milestones (MVP):

Early Game: Focus on generating initial money, hiring the first Junior Developer, and releasing the first feature.

Mid Game: Balance feature development with managing Customer Satisfaction. Aim to unlock all MVP features.

Late Game (MVP): The "endgame" for MVP is to achieve a significant Delight Score by consistently delighting customers through feature releases and high satisfaction.

A single, central button for "Generate Income" (the initial clicker mechanic).

Sections/Tabs:

Development Tab: Contains buttons/progress bars for "Research New Feature," "Fix Bug," and hiring "Junior Developer."

Operations Tab: Contains the "Upgrade Servers" button.

Notifications: Simple text notifications for important events like "New feature released!", "Satisfaction is dropping!", or "Delight Event triggered!"
