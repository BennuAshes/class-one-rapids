# Phase 0: Requirements Analysis & Architecture Review

## Overview
This phase focuses on analyzing the technical requirements and establishing the correct architectural foundation based on vertical slicing principles.

## Objectives
- ✅ Validate technical requirements against PRD specifications
- ✅ Define vertical slicing architecture boundaries
- ✅ Identify critical dependencies and technology stack
- ✅ Plan migration from current centralized architecture

## Current Architecture Issues

### ❌ Problems in Existing Implementation
1. **Centralized Store Violation:** Current `src/core/state/gameStore.ts` contains all features
2. **Wrong Directory Structure:** Uses `src/` instead of `app/` for Expo Router
3. **Tight Coupling:** All features mixed together in single store
4. **Performance Risk:** Monolithic state causes unnecessary re-renders

### ✅ Required Architecture Changes
```
BEFORE (Current - WRONG):
src/core/state/gameStore.ts
├── departments: []
├── player: {}
└── progression: {}

AFTER (Required - CORRECT):
features/departments/state/departmentStore.ts
features/player/state/playerStore.ts  
features/progression/state/progressionStore.ts
```

## Technical Stack Analysis

### Core Dependencies
```json
{
  "react-native": "0.76.9+",           // New Architecture + Hermes
  "@expo/cli": "latest",                // SDK 52 support
  "@legendapp/state": "3.0.0-beta",   // 5KB observable state
  "expo-router": "~4.0.0",             // File-based navigation
  "typescript": "^5.3.0"               // Strict mode required
}
```

### Performance Requirements Validation
| Requirement | Target | Implementation Strategy |
|------------|--------|------------------------|
| **60 FPS** | Consistent | RequestAnimationFrame game loop + memo |
| **<50ms Input** | Response time | Optimistic updates + immediate feedback |
| **<3s Load** | Cold start | Code splitting + lazy loading |
| **<200MB Memory** | Runtime usage | FlatList virtualization + cleanup |

## Feature Boundary Analysis

### Core Features (Vertical Slices)
1. **Player Management** (`features/player/`)
   - Cash, valuation, experience tracking
   - Statistics and session data
   - Level progression

2. **Department System** (`features/departments/`)
   - 7 departments with unique mechanics
   - Employee management per department
   - Production calculations and upgrades

3. **Progression System** (`features/progression/`)
   - Achievement tracking (50+ achievements)
   - Prestige/Investor Points system
   - Milestone unlocks

4. **Save System** (`features/save-system/`)
   - Auto-save every 30 seconds
   - Compression and checksum validation
   - Version migration support

5. **Audio System** (`features/audio/`)
   - Contextual sound effects
   - Dynamic volume control
   - Event-driven audio triggers

### Cross-Feature Communication Strategy
```typescript
// Event Bus Pattern for Feature Coordination
shared/utils/eventBus.ts
├── emit('revenue_earned', { amount })
├── emit('department_unlocked', { department })
└── emit('achievement_earned', { id })

// Features subscribe to relevant events only
features/departments/state/departmentStore.ts
└── subscribe('revenue_earned', updateUnlocks)

features/progression/state/progressionStore.ts  
└── subscribe('achievement_earned', updateProgress)
```

## Game Mechanics Requirements

### Department Production Chain
```
Development:    Clicks + Employees → Lines of Code
Conversion:     Lines of Code → Features (Basic/Advanced/Premium)  
Sales:          Features + Leads → Revenue
Marketing:      Brand Points → Lead Multipliers
Product:        Enhanced Features (2x value)
Design:         Polish Multiplier
QA:             Bug Prevention  
Customer Exp:   Retention Multiplier
```

### Unlock Progression
```
Start:          Development Department available
$500:           Sales Department unlocks
$50K:           Marketing Department unlocks  
$500K:          Product Department unlocks
$5M:            Design Department unlocks
$50M:           QA Department unlocks
$500M:          Customer Experience unlocks
```

### Prestige System
```
Minimum:        $10M valuation for first prestige
Calculation:    1 Investor Point per $1M valuation
Multipliers:    Series A (1.5x), Series B (2x), Series C (3x)
Bonuses:        Starting capital, global speed, synergy bonuses
```

## Performance Architecture

### Game Loop Implementation
```typescript
// 60 FPS game loop with delta time
features/automation/gameLoop.tsx
├── requestAnimationFrame cycle
├── Delta time calculations (16.67ms target)
├── Production updates per feature
└── Performance monitoring
```

### Legend State Optimization
```typescript
// Fine-grained reactivity - only re-render what changes
const DepartmentCard = ({ departmentId }) => {
  // Only this specific department triggers re-render
  const department = departmentStore.departments[departmentId].use()
  
  return <DepartmentView department={department} />
}
```

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 0A: Analysis & Planning (Day 1)
- [ ] Complete architecture analysis
- [ ] Identify all current violations
- [ ] Plan feature extraction order
- [ ] Create compatibility layer strategy

### Phase 0B: Foundation Setup (Days 2-3)  
- [ ] Initialize new project structure
- [ ] Set up development toolchain
- [ ] Configure vertical slicing directories
- [ ] Implement event bus system

### Phase 0C: Migration Preparation (Days 4-5)
- [ ] Create feature store templates
- [ ] Plan backwards compatibility
- [ ] Set up testing infrastructure
- [ ] Validate performance monitoring

## Validation Criteria

### ✅ Architecture Compliance Checklist
- [ ] No centralized `gameStore.ts` exists
- [ ] Each feature has isolated `/state/store.ts`
- [ ] `app/` directory used for Expo Router
- [ ] Cross-feature communication via event bus only
- [ ] Legend State observables used correctly

### ✅ Performance Baseline
- [ ] 60 FPS sustained during idle state
- [ ] <50ms input response measured
- [ ] <3s app startup time recorded
- [ ] Memory usage profiled and optimized
- [ ] Bundle size under platform limits

### ✅ Development Environment
- [ ] ESLint strict mode passing
- [ ] TypeScript strict compilation
- [ ] Jest test runner configured
- [ ] Performance monitoring active
- [ ] Platform builds working (iOS/Android/Web)

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
```typescript
const PERFORMANCE_TARGETS = {
  FPS_TARGET: 60,
  RESPONSE_TIME_MAX: 50,      // milliseconds
  LOAD_TIME_MAX: 3000,        // milliseconds
  MEMORY_MAX: 200,            // MB  
  BUNDLE_SIZE_IOS_MAX: 50,    // MB
  BUNDLE_SIZE_ANDROID_MAX: 30 // MB
}
```

### Architecture Validation
- Zero centralized stores detected
- Each feature completely independent  
- Event bus used for all cross-feature communication
- Expo Router `app/` directory structure
- Legend State observable patterns correctly implemented

## Next Phase Readiness

### Prerequisites for Phase 1
1. **✅ Vertical slicing architecture established**
2. **✅ Development environment fully configured** 
3. **✅ Performance monitoring baseline captured**
4. **✅ Event bus communication system working**

- **Performance Regression:** Continuous monitoring with alerts
- **Complexity Management:** Strict feature boundaries enforced
- **Team Alignment:** Architecture decisions documented and reviewed
