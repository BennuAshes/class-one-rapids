# Phase 0: Analysis & Architecture Review

**Duration**: 1-2 days  
**Status**: Not Started  
**Prerequisites**: Technical requirements document review

## Objectives

1. Validate technical requirements against business goals
2. Identify potential architectural risks and mitigation strategies  
3. Establish development environment requirements
4. Create implementation timeline with realistic estimates
5. Define success criteria and validation checkpoints

## Requirements Analysis

### Core Game Mechanics Review

#### Primary Game Loop
- **Manual Income**: Click mechanics for direct revenue generation
- **Automated Production**: Department-based passive income system
- **Resource Management**: Money accumulation and strategic spending
- **Progression System**: Employee hiring and department upgrades
- **Prestige Mechanics**: Long-term progression via investor points

#### Technical Requirements Validation

| Requirement | Business Impact | Technical Complexity | Risk Level |
|-------------|----------------|---------------------|------------|
| 60 FPS animations | High - User retention | Medium | Low |
| <50ms interaction response | High - User experience | Medium | Low |
| BigNumber support (>10^15) | High - Late game scaling | High | Medium |
| Cross-platform support | High - Market reach | Medium | Low |
| Offline progress calculation | Medium - User convenience | Medium | Medium |
| Save data integrity | Critical - Data loss prevention | High | High |

### Architecture Validation

#### Chosen Architecture: Vertical Slicing
**Justification**: 
- Aligns with feature-driven development
- Reduces cross-cutting concerns
- Enables parallel development of game systems
- Simplifies testing and maintenance

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Low Risk**: Well-established pattern with proven benefits
- **Mitigation**: Follow quick-ref.md patterns exactly

#### State Management Strategy
**Global State (Zustand)**: Game state, settings, statistics
**Server State (TanStack Query v5)**: Save/load operations, analytics
**Local State (React)**: UI interactions, animations

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Medium Risk**: Complexity in state synchronization
- **Mitigation**: Clear boundaries between state types, comprehensive testing

#### Performance Strategy
**Target**: 60 FPS sustained performance
**Approach**: 
- Fixed timestep game loop with interpolation
- Object pooling for particles and animations
- Virtualized lists for department management
- Memory monitoring and cleanup

**Risk Assessment**:
- **Medium Risk**: React Native performance on lower-end devices
- **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring, progressive feature degradation

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Environment Requirements

#### Required Software
```bash
# Node.js version manager (recommended)
nvm install 20.17.0  # LTS version
nvm use 20.17.0

# Package managers
npm --version  # Should be 10.x+
npx --version  # Should be 10.x+

# Mobile development tools
# iOS: Xcode 15+ (Mac only)
# Android: Android Studio with SDK 34+
# Web: Modern browser with dev tools
```

#### Project Dependencies Verification
```bash
# Verify Expo CLI
npx expo --version  # Should be 51.x+

# Verify React Native compatibility  
npx react-native --version  # Should be 0.79.x
```

### Risk Assessment & Mitigation

#### High-Risk Areas

**1. Save Data Integrity (Risk: Critical)**
- **Issue**: Data corruption could lose player progress
- **Mitigation**: 
  - Multiple backup saves with rotation
  - Checksum validation on all save/load operations
  - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
  - Regular save validation during development

**2. BigNumber Performance (Risk: Medium)**  
- **Issue**: Large number calculations could impact frame rate
- **Mitigation**:
  - Custom BigNumber implementation optimized for game needs
  - Lazy calculation with caching
  - Performance monitoring for number operations
  - Fallback to scientific notation display

**3. Memory Management (Risk: Medium)**
- **Issue**: Memory leaks could cause crashes on mobile devices
- **Mitigation**:
  - Continuous memory monitoring
  - Object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
  - Regular cleanup of unused resources
  - Memory profiling during development

#### Medium-Risk Areas

**1. Cross-Platform Consistency (Risk: Medium)**
- **Issue**: Different behavior between iOS/Android/Web
- **Mitigation**:
  - Platform-specific testing on each target
  - Conditional logic for platform differences
  - Expo's platform abstractions where possible

**2. Animation Performance (Risk: Medium)**  
- **Issue**: Complex animations could drop frame rate
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use React Native Reanimated's native thread
  - Progressive animation complexity based on device performance
  - Animation profiling and optimization

### Success Criteria

#### Phase 0 Completion Criteria
- [ ] All technical requirements validated against business goals
- [ ] Development environment properly configured and tested
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies documented and approved
- [ ] Implementation timeline created with buffer time
- [ ] Architecture decisions documented and validated
- [ ] Team alignment on technical approach

#### Validation Checkpoints

**Architecture Validation**
```bash
# Verify project structure follows vertical slicing
ls -la src/features/  # Should exist and be empty initially
ls -la src/core/      # Should exist and be empty initially
ls -la src/shared/    # Should exist and be empty initially

# Verify TypeScript configuration
npx tsc --noEmit      # Should complete without errors
```

**Development Environment Validation**
```bash
# Verify Expo development server
npx expo start --dev-client  # Should start without errors

# Verify platform support
npx expo run:ios     # Should build and run (Mac only)
npx expo run:android # Should build and run
npx expo run:web     # Should build and run
```

## Architecture Decision Records

### ADR-001: State Management
**Decision**: Use Zustand for global game state + TanStack Query v5 for save/load operations
**Rationale**: Zustand provides simple, performant global state without React Context overhead. TanStack Query excels at async operations with caching and error handling.
**Status**: Approved

### ADR-002: Component Architecture  
**Decision**: Vertical slicing by feature over horizontal layering
**Rationale**: Vertical slicing enables faster feature development and better code organization for game systems.
**Status**: Approved

### ADR-003: Performance Strategy
**Decision**: Fixed timestep game loop with interpolation + React Native Reanimated for animations
**Rationale**: Fixed timestep ensures consistent game logic across devices. Reanimated provides native thread animations for 60 FPS.
**Status**: Approved

### ADR-004: Cross-Platform Strategy
**Decision**: Single codebase with Expo SDK 53+ targeting iOS, Android, and Web
**Rationale**: Expo provides excellent cross-platform support with minimal platform-specific code required.
**Status**: Approved
