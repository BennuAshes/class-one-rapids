## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues or Deviations (Count: 3)

### 1. TypeScript Module Resolution
**Issue**: Uses `moduleResolution: "node"` instead of `"nodenext"`
**Impact**: Low - Both work fine with current setup
**Recommendation**: Consider upgrading to `"nodenext"` for future compatibility

### 2. Missing Query Options Factory Pattern Example
**Issue**: While TanStack Query v5 is specified, detailed `queryOptions` factory patterns could be more explicit
**Impact**: Low - Implementation is correct but could be clearer
**Recommendation**: Add more examples of the `queryOptions` pattern from quick-ref

### 3. Audio File Paths in Production
**Issue**: Audio assets use relative require paths that may need verification in production builds
**Impact**: Medium - Could cause build issues if paths are incorrect
**Recommendation**: Verify audio asset paths work in production builds

## üí° Recommendations for Improvement (Count: 4)

### 1. Enhanced BigNumber Caching
**Current**: Basic string caching implemented
**Recommendation**: Add more aggressive caching for frequently accessed values
**Impact**: Performance improvement for large number operations

### 2. Web-Specific Optimizations
**Current**: General cross-platform approach
**Recommendation**: Add web-specific optimizations (service worker, progressive loading)
**Impact**: Better web performance and user experience

### 3. Additional Testing Strategies
**Current**: Good test coverage target (70%)
**Recommendation**: Add performance regression tests and visual testing
**Impact**: Better quality assurance and reduced performance regressions

### 4. Analytics Integration Depth
**Current**: Basic analytics framework
**Recommendation**: Add more game-specific metrics and user behavior tracking
**Impact**: Better post-launch optimization and user understanding
