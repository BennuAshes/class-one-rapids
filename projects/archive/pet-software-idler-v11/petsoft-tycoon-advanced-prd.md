## 2. Core Game Loop & Mechanics

### Primary Game Loop (10-Second Cycle)
```
Click "Write Code" → Generate Lines of Code → Ship Features → Earn Money → 
Buy More Developers → Automate Production → Scale Operations
```

### Idle/Clicker Mechanics Foundation

#### Base Resource System
- **Primary Resource**: Lines of Code (generated by clicking or automation)
- **Secondary Resources**: Features, Customer Leads, Revenue, Prestige Points
- **Conversion Chain**: Lines → Features → Sales → Revenue → Growth

#### Automation Hierarchy
- **Manual Phase** (0-30 seconds): Direct clicking required
- **Basic Automation** (30 seconds - 2 minutes): First developers auto-generate code
- **Department Automation** (2+ minutes): Managers automate entire workflows
- **Prestige Automation** (Late game): Investor Points provide permanent bonuses

#### Department Synergy System
```
Development (Code) → Sales (Leads + Features = Revenue) → 
Customer Experience (Retention Multiplier) → Product (Feature Enhancement) → 
Design (Polish Multiplier) → QA (Cost Savings) → Marketing (Lead Amplification)
```

### Critical First 5 Minutes Design
- **0-10 seconds**: Big pulsing "WRITE CODE" button, immediate +1 feedback
- **10-30 seconds**: First automation (Junior Dev) available after 5 clicks
- **30-60 seconds**: Money system introduced, growth loop established
- **1-2 minutes**: Department expansion tease, office visual growth
- **2-3 minutes**: Sales department unlock, full business cycle revealed
- **3-5 minutes**: Strategic depth apparent, prestige system hinted
