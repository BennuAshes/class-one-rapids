## Research Principle Compliance Analysis

### 1. Vertical Slicing Compliance: ✅ **PASS** (100%)

**✅ COMPLIANT PATTERNS VERIFIED:**
- **Feature-Based Organization**: Clear feature directories structure
  ```
  src/features/
  ├── core-gameplay/
  ├── department-systems/
  ├── prestige-system/
  └── audio-visual/
  ```
- **High Cohesion Within Slices**: Each feature contains complete functionality (components, hooks, state, tests)
- **Low Coupling Between Slices**: Minimal cross-feature dependencies
- **INVEST Criteria Application**: Features are Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable
- **End-to-End Functionality**: Complete implementation spanning all application layers
- **User Value Focus**: Direct mapping to user stories (US-PST-001 through US-PST-010)

**✅ NO FORBIDDEN PATTERNS DETECTED:**
- ✅ No horizontal layering (entities/, services/, utils/ outside features)
- ✅ No technical layer separation anti-patterns
- ✅ Feature code physically co-located for maintainability

**RESEARCH REFERENCE**: `research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84` - Feature-based folder structure requirement

---

### 2. React Native Standards Compliance: ⚠️ **CONDITIONAL PASS** (85%)

**✅ COMPLIANT PATTERNS VERIFIED:**
- **Feature-Based Component Organization**: Components properly organized by domain
- **Custom Hooks Implementation**: State logic extracted to hooks (`useGameLoop`, `useEmployeeHiring`, `useCameraTransition`)
- **PascalCase Component Naming**: Consistent naming (`WriteCodeButton`, `PrestigeDialog`, `OfficeLayout`)
- **Mobile-Specific Patterns**: Proper React Native API usage (`Animated`, `Pressable`, `Platform`)
- **Hook Pattern Usage**: Reusable logic implemented as custom hooks, not utility functions

**❌ VIOLATIONS REQUIRING REMEDIATION:**

#### Violation #1: Barrel Export Files Present
- **Location**: `src/shared/types/index.ts`
- **Pattern**: Re-export index files detected
- **Research Violation**: `research/tech/react-native.md:1589-1614` - Direct imports preferred over barrel exports
- **Impact**: Creates unnecessary abstraction layers and import complexity

#### Violation #2: Shared Directory Horizontal Layering
- **Location**: `src/shared/` directory structure
- **Pattern**: Cross-cutting utilities outside feature boundaries
- **Research Violation**: `research/tech/react-native.md:1656-1673` - Component organization should be feature-centric
- **Impact**: Partial horizontal layering contradicts vertical slicing principles

**RESEARCH REFERENCE**: `research/tech/react-native.md:1589-1673` - React Native component organization patterns

---

### 3. Legend State Architecture Compliance: ✅ **PASS** (90%)

**✅ COMPLIANT PATTERNS VERIFIED:**
- **Modular Observable Structure**: Clear state separation (`gameState$`, `computedValues$`)
- **State Co-location**: State managed within features where used
- **Observable Composition**: Proper computed values and reactive patterns
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all state shapes
- **Performance Patterns**: Fine-grained reactivity and automatic persistence
- **Reactive Architecture**: Proper Legend State patterns throughout

**⚠️ MINOR ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS (Non-blocking):**
- **Centralized State Pattern**: Single `gameState$` observable may become monolithic as features grow
- **Cross-Feature State Sharing**: Some game mechanics require shared state access patterns
- **State Boundary Management**: Future feature additions may challenge current state organization

**RESEARCH REFERENCE**: `research/tech/legend-state.md:388-417` - Modular Legend State patterns

---

### 4. Structured Task Decomposition Compliance: ✅ **PASS** (100%)

**✅ COMPLIANT PATTERNS VERIFIED:**
- **Atomic Actionability**: All tasks include complete implementation details with working code examples
- **Cognitive Load Management**: 5-phase hierarchy respects Miller's 7±2 rule
- **Progressive Elaboration**: Near-term phases fully detailed, future phases appropriately high-level
- **Implementation Content**: No empty directory creation - all tasks produce working deliverables
- **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable success criteria for each task
- **Single Point of Accountability**: Each task clearly assigned to appropriate skill level
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Clear parent-child relationships in task structure

**RESEARCH REFERENCE**: `research/planning/structured-task-decomposition-research.md:132` - Atomic actionability test

## Detailed Violation Analysis and Remediation Requirements

### VIOLATION #1: Barrel Export Files (Critical - Must Fix Before Implementation)

**Problem Description:**
The runbook specifies creation of `src/shared/types/index.ts` with barrel exports, violating React Native direct import patterns.

**Code Example from Runbook:**
```typescript
// src/shared/types/index.ts
export * from './GameState';
export * from './Employee';
export * from './Department';
```

**Research Principle Violated:**
- `research/tech/react-native.md:1589-1614` - "Implement custom hooks over utilities"
- Direct imports preferred for better IDE support and tree-shaking

**Required Remediation:**
1. **Remove barrel export files**: Eliminate `index.ts` re-export files
2. **Use direct imports**: Import directly from source files
3. **Update import patterns**: 
   ```typescript
   // Instead of: import { GameState } from '../types';
   // Use: import { GameState } from '../types/GameState';
   ```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] All `index.ts` barrel export files removed
- [ ] Direct import patterns implemented throughout codebase
- [ ] Import statements point to actual source files

---

### VIOLATION #2: Shared Directory Horizontal Layering (Critical - Must Fix Before Implementation)

**Problem Description:**
The `src/shared/` directory creates partial horizontal layering, contradicting vertical slicing principles.

**Architectural Pattern Detected:**
```
src/
├── features/           # Vertical slices ✅
└── shared/            # Horizontal layer ❌
    ├── components/
    ├── hooks/
    ├── utils/
    └── types/
```

**Research Principle Violated:**
- `research/planning/vertical-slicing.md:83-84` - Feature-based folder structure
- `research/tech/react-native.md:1656-1673` - Component organization by feature

**Required Remediation:**
1. **Eliminate shared directory**: Move shared utilities into features that use them
2. **Duplicate common code initially**: Follow DRY principles through refactoring, not upfront abstraction
3. **Create feature-specific utilities**: Each feature owns its utilities
4. **Establish extraction criteria**: Only extract shared code when used by 3+ features

**Recommended Architecture:**
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── core-gameplay/
│   │   ├── components/
│   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   ├── utils/          # Feature-specific utilities
│   │   ├── types/          # Feature-specific types
│   │   └── state/
│   ├── department-systems/
│   └── prestige-system/
└── App.tsx
```

**Validation Criteria:**
- [ ] `src/shared/` directory eliminated
- [ ] All utilities co-located within features that use them
- [ ] Common code duplicated initially (3+ usage rule for extraction)
- [ ] Feature boundaries clearly maintained

## Remediation Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Structural Corrections (Required Before Development Start)

#### Task 1.1: Remove Barrel Export Patterns
- **Duration**: 1-2 hours
- **Assignee**: Senior Developer
- **Actions**:
  1. Remove all `index.ts` files from type directories
  2. Update import statements to direct file imports
  3. Verify build system handles direct imports correctly
  4. Update runbook documentation with corrected patterns

#### Task 1.2: Eliminate Shared Directory Structure  
- **Duration**: 2-3 hours
- **Assignee**: Senior Developer

  1. Move `src/shared/types/` into relevant feature directories
  2. Move `src/shared/hooks/` into features that use them
  3. Move `src/shared/utils/` into appropriate feature contexts
  4. Update all import paths to reflect new structure
  5. Verify no circular dependencies created

### Phase 2: Architecture Validation (After Remediation)
- **Re-run validation checklist**: Confirm 100% compliance
