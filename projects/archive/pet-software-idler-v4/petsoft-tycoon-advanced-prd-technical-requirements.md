└── App.tsx                     // Root application component
```

### State Management Strategy

#### Legend State Implementation for Idle Game Mechanics

**Core Game State Architecture:**
```typescript
// Example of optimized idle game state structure
const gameState$ = observable({
  // Core resources with automatic persistence
  resources: {
    linesOfCode: 0,
    money: 0,
    customerLeads: 0,
  },
  
  // Department systems with automated calculations
  departments: {
    development: {
      employees: [],
      totalOutput: () => gameState$.departments.development.employees.reduce((sum, emp) => sum + emp.productivity, 0)
    },
    sales: {
      employees: [],
      leadGeneration: () => gameState$.departments.sales.employees.length * 0.2
    }
  },
  
  // Prestige system with permanent bonuses
  prestige: {
    investorPoints: 0,
    currentRound: 0,
    permanentBonuses: {
      globalSpeedMultiplier: () => 1 + (gameState$.prestige.investorPoints * 0.01),
      startingCapitalBonus: () => gameState$.prestige.investorPoints * 0.1
    }
  },
  
  // Meta-game state
  gameTime: Date.now(),
  lastSaveTime: Date.now(),
  
  // Calculated properties for UI
  totalIncome$: () => {
    const devOutput = gameState$.departments.development.totalOutput.get();
    const salesMultiplier = gameState$.departments.sales.leadGeneration.get();
    return devOutput * (1 + salesMultiplier) * gameState$.prestige.permanentBonuses.globalSpeedMultiplier.get();
  }
});

// Automatic persistence with cloud sync capability
syncObservable(gameState$, {
  persist: { 
    name: 'petsoft-tycoon-save',
    plugin: ObservablePersistLocalStorage 
  },
  // Future: Cloud save integration
  // sync: {
  //   get: () => fetchCloudSave(userId),
  //   set: ({ value }) => saveToCloud(userId, value)
  // }
});
```

**Key State Management Benefits:**
- **Automatic Persistence**: Game state automatically saved every change, critical for idle games
- **Fine-Grained Reactivity**: Only affected UI components re-render when specific values change
- **Computed Properties**: Automatic calculation of derived values like total income, efficiency ratings
