**User Story**: As a new player, I want to immediately start generating value through simple interactions so that I understand the core game mechanic within 10 seconds.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I am on the game start screen
- When I click the "WRITE CODE" button
- Then I receive +1 Line of Code with visual and audio feedback
- And the counter updates immediately with typewriter sound effect
- And after 5 clicks, the "Hire Junior Dev $10" option becomes available
- And all interactions respond within 50ms

#### US-PST-002: First Automation
**User Story**: As a player who has clicked several times, I want to hire my first automated unit so that I can see the progression from manual to automated gameplay.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have earned $10 and the Junior Dev option is available
- When I purchase the Junior Dev
- Then a developer sprite appears at a desk
- And automatically generates 0.1 lines of code per second
- And the "Ship Feature" button becomes available
- And I can convert 10 lines of code into $15 revenue

#### US-PST-003: Growth Loop Establishment
**User Story**: As a player experiencing automation, I want to see clear paths for reinvestment and growth so that the core feedback loop becomes apparent.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have active automated code generation
- When I accumulate enough money for additional developers
- Then each subsequent developer costs 2.5x the previous (exponential scaling)
- And the "Upgrade Laptop" option appears at $100 (2x code speed)
- And I can visibly see the relationship: Code → Features → Money → More Devs

### Epic 2: Department Systems
**As a player, I want to manage multiple business departments with unique mechanics so that I can experience strategic depth and meaningful choices.**

#### US-PST-004: Sales Department Unlock
**User Story**: As a player who has mastered the development department, I want to unlock sales capabilities so that I can increase revenue through customer acquisition.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have earned $500 total revenue
- When the sales department unlocks
- Then I can hire Sales Reps for $100 each
- And Sales Reps generate 0.2 Customer Leads per second
- And I can combine Leads + Features for higher revenue than raw features
- And the office visual expands to show the new department

#### US-PST-005: Department Synergies
**User Story**: As a player managing multiple departments, I want to see how departments work together so that I can make strategic decisions about resource allocation.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have active Development and Sales departments
- When I have both Customer Leads and completed Features
- Then I can convert them together for bonus revenue
- And the conversion rate is: 1 Lead + 1 Basic Feature = $50 (vs $15 for raw features)
- And visual connection lines show department interactions
- And department efficiency meters display current performance

### Epic 3: Prestige System
**As a player, I want meaningful reset mechanics that provide permanent progression so that I have long-term goals beyond the initial gameplay loop.**

#### US-PST-006: Investor Rounds (Prestige)
**User Story**: As a player who has reached significant milestones, I want to reset my progress for permanent bonuses so that I can progress faster in subsequent runs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have reached $10M company valuation
- When I choose to trigger an Investor Round
- Then I reset all current progress (departments, money, etc.)
- And I gain Investor Points (IP) at 1 IP per $1M valuation
- And IP provides permanent bonuses: +10% starting capital, +1% global speed
- And prestige confirmation dialog prevents accidental resets
- And my investor round history is saved and displayed

#### US-PST-007: Advanced Prestige Tiers
**User Story**: As a player with multiple prestige resets, I want enhanced prestige benefits so that each reset feels meaningfully different.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have completed multiple investor rounds
- When I reach Series A ($10M+) or Series B ($100M+) thresholds
- Then I receive enhanced IP conversion rates
- And unlock exclusive Super Units at 100, 1K, 10K IP thresholds
- And department synergy bonuses increase by +2% per 10 IP
- And prestige progression is visually represented with investor meeting animations

**User Story**: As a player taking any action, I want immediate and satisfying visual feedback so that my interactions feel impactful and rewarding.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I perform any game action (clicking, purchasing, upgrading)
- When the action completes
- Then I see appropriate visual feedback: number popup, screen shake, particle effects
- And feedback intensity scales with action significance
- And animations complete smoothly at 60fps
- And color progression follows white → green → gold for value tiers

#### US-PST-009: Audio Design
**User Story**: As a player, I want contextual audio feedback that enhances the experience without becoming repetitive or annoying.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I have audio enabled
- When I perform actions
- Then each action type has a distinct sound: keyboard clicks for coding, cash register for sales
- And sounds never repeat within 0.5 seconds
- And volume scales inversely to frequency (frequent actions are quieter)
- And milestone achievements override normal sounds with celebration audio
- And I can disable audio while maintaining visual feedback

#### US-PST-010: Office Evolution
**User Story**: As a player progressing through the game, I want to see my virtual office grow and change so that my progression is visually represented in the game world.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Given I reach specific revenue milestones
- When I cross threshold values ($10K, $1M, $100M, $1B)
- Then the office visually evolves: Garage → Small Office → Medium Office → Campus → Tech Giant HQ
- And camera smoothly zooms out to accommodate larger spaces
- And new departments appear in appropriate office areas
