**Total Estimated Time: 16 hours**

## Dependencies

### Blocks
- **Story 1.3**: Resource system needs click generation working
- **Story 1.4**: Automation system depends on established click mechanics
- **Story 1.5**: UI foundation needs button interaction patterns

### Blocked by
- **Story 1.1**: Requires game loop, state management, and event system

### Technical Dependencies
- Web Audio API availability in target browsers
- Touch event support for mobile compatibility
- RequestAnimationFrame for smooth animations
- DOM event handling capabilities

## Definition of Done

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Click button generates +1 Lines of Code immediately
- [ ] Visual response appears within 50ms of click
- [ ] Typewriter sound plays with each click
- [ ] Touch events work correctly on mobile devices
- [ ] Spam protection prevents excessive clicking (>20/sec)

### Performance Requirements
- [ ] Button remains responsive during rapid clicking
- [ ] Animations maintain 60 FPS during click sequences
- [ ] Memory usage stable during extended clicking sessions
- [ ] Audio latency under 100ms for immediate feedback

### Quality Standards
- [ ] Visual feedback feels immediately satisfying
- [ ] Button states (hover, active) transition smoothly
- [ ] Number popup animations follow proper easing curves
- [ ] Audio doesn't overlap or create noise during rapid clicks
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified

### Integration Completeness
- [ ] State management integration handles click events correctly
- [ ] Resource updates trigger UI refreshes appropriately
- [ ] Performance monitoring tracks click responsiveness
- [ ] Event cleanup prevents memory leaks

### User Experience Validation
- [ ] First click within 10 seconds feels immediately rewarding
- [ ] Clicking rhythm feels satisfying and not tedious
- [ ] Visual and audio feedback creates positive feedback loop
- [ ] Mobile touch experience matches desktop click experience

## Resources Required

### Technical Skills
- **DOM Event Handling**: Mouse and touch event processing
- **Web Audio API**: Sound loading, playback, and optimization
