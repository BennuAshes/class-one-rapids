## Dependencies

### Blocks
- **Story 1.5**: UI foundation needs automation interface components
- **Epic 2**: Department systems build on automation framework
- All future automation features depend on this foundation

### Blocked by
- **Story 1.2**: Needs click system to track clicks for unlock timing
- **Story 1.3**: Requires resource system for purchase costs and production

### Technical Dependencies
- Animation system for sprite movements
- Resource management for purchase validation
- Game loop integration for continuous production
- State persistence for automation state

## Definition of Done

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Junior Dev purchasable for $10 after player has enough money
- [ ] Junior Dev produces 0.1 lines of code per second continuously
- [ ] Cost scaling works correctly: 2nd dev costs $11.50, 3rd costs $13.23
- [ ] Purchase button shows current cost and availability
- [ ] Production runs automatically and updates resources

### Visual Requirements
- [ ] Animated developer sprite typing at desk
- [ ] Visual confirmation of production (particles, numbers)
- [ ] Purchase celebration effect feels rewarding
- [ ] Unit count displayed clearly
- [ ] Production rate visible and updates in real-time

### Mathematical Accuracy
- [ ] Cost scaling formula: baseCost * (1.15 ^ owned) implemented correctly
- [ ] Production rate: 0.1 lines/second per Junior Dev verified
- [ ] Resource integration maintains precision
- [ ] No floating point errors in cost calculations
- [ ] Production accumulates correctly over time

### Performance Standards
- [ ] Production calculations efficient for up to 100 units
- [ ] Visual animations maintain 60 FPS
- [ ] Purchase operations respond within 50ms
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended automation
- [ ] Save/load includes automation state correctly

### User Experience
- [ ] First automation purchase feels like meaningful progression
- [ ] Automation provides clear value over manual clicking
- [ ] Cost progression creates anticipation for next purchase
- [ ] Visual feedback makes automation feel alive and productive
- [ ] Unlock timing feels appropriately paced (not too early/late)

## Resources Required

### Technical Skills
