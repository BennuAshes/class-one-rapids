# Story 1.1: Project Architecture Setup

## User Story
**As a** developer, **I want** a robust technical foundation **so that** I can build features efficiently with excellent performance.


## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Vanilla JavaScript/TypeScript project with no external dependencies
- [ ] 60 FPS game loop using RequestAnimationFrame
- [ ] Modular architecture supporting feature addition
- [ ] Performance monitoring built-in (FPS, memory, load time)
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design (tablet+)


## Technical Design

### Project Structure (Vertical Slicing Pattern)
```
src/
├── features/
│   ├── clicking/           # Epic 1: Core gameplay
│   ├── departments/        # Epic 2: Department systems  
│   ├── progression/        # Epic 3: Prestige and achievements
│   ├── audio-visual/       # Epic 4: Polish systems
│   └── persistence/        # Epic 5: Save system
├── shared/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── types/
│   └── constants/
└── core/
    ├── gameLoop.ts
    ├── eventSystem.ts
    └── stateManager.ts
```

### Core Game Loop Architecture
```typescript
interface GameLoop {
  start(): void;
  stop(): void;
  update(deltaTime: number): void;
  render(): void;
  getPerformanceMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics;
}

interface PerformanceMetrics {
  fps: number;
  memoryUsage: number;
  frameTime: number;
  lastFrameTime: number;
}
```

### State Management Architecture
Based on Legend State and state management research:
```typescript
interface GameState {
  resources: {
    linesOfCode: number;
    money: number;
    features: number;
  };
  departments: Record<string, DepartmentState>;
  progression: ProgressionState;
  meta: MetaState;
}
```

## API Contracts

### Core Module Interfaces
```typescript
// Core game loop interface
export interface IGameLoop {
  start(): void;
  stop(): void;
  update(deltaTime: number): void;
  render(): void;
}

// Performance monitoring interface
export interface IPerformanceMonitor {
  trackFPS(fps: number): void;
  trackMemory(usage: number): void;
  getMetrics(): PerformanceMetrics;
}

// Event system interface
export interface IEventSystem {
  emit(event: string, data?: any): void;
  on(event: string, callback: Function): void;
  off(event: string, callback: Function): void;
}
```

### Build System Configuration
```typescript
// TypeScript configuration
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "ES2020",
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "moduleResolution": "node",
    "outDir": "./dist",
    "sourceMap": true
  }
}
```


## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Project Initialization
1. Create project directory structure following vertical slicing pattern
2. Initialize TypeScript configuration with strict settings
3. Set up ES6 module system for modern JavaScript features
4. Configure development server with hot reload capabilities
5. Initialize git repository with comprehensive .gitignore

### Step 2: Core Game Loop Implementation
1. Create RequestAnimationFrame-based game loop
2. Implement fixed timestep logic for consistent simulation
3. Add performance monitoring (FPS counter, memory tracking)
4. Create adaptive quality system for frame rate management
5. Test loop stability under various device conditions

### Step 3: State Management Foundation
1. Design immutable state architecture following research patterns
2. Implement centralized state store with TypeScript interfaces
3. Create state update system with validation and bounds checking
4. Add state subscription system for UI updates
5. Implement state history for debugging capabilities

### Step 4: Module System Setup
1. Create feature module structure aligned with epic organization
2. Set up shared utilities and type definitions
3. Implement event system for loose coupling between modules
4. Create module loading and initialization system
5. Add hot reload support for development efficiency
