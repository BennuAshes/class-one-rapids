# Cross-Epic Dependencies

## Epic Dependency Map

### Epic 1: Core Gameplay Foundation
**Dependencies:** None (foundational)
**Blocks:** All other epics depend on Epic 1 completion

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Project architecture (Story 1.1) → All future development
- Resource system (Story 1.3) → All department systems and progression
- Automation framework (Story 1.4) → Department automation
- UI foundation (Story 1.5) → All user interfaces

### Epic 2: Department Systems Implementation
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (complete automation and resource framework)
**Blocks:** Epic 3 (progression needs departments), Epic 4 (polish needs complete game)

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Development Department (Story 2.1) → Framework for all other departments
- Sales Department (Story 2.2) → Revenue generation for unlocks
- Department Synergy (Story 2.8) → Strategic depth and optimization

### Epic 3: Progression and Prestige Systems
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (state management), Epic 2 (department milestones)
**Blocks:** Long-term retention and meta-progression

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Prestige System (Story 3.1) → Long-term progression goals
- Achievement System (Story 3.2) → Progress tracking and rewards
- Statistics (Story 3.3) → Performance analytics and optimization

### Epic 4: Audio and Visual Polish
**Dependencies:** Epic 1 (animation framework), Epic 2 (game mechanics complete)
**Blocks:** MVP launch readiness

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Visual Feedback (Story 4.1) → Core player satisfaction
- Audio Design (Story 4.2) → Immersive experience
- Animation Polish (Story 4.3) → Premium feel

### Epic 5: Persistence and Progression
**Dependencies:** All epics (complete game state to persist)
**Blocks:** Player retention across sessions

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Save System (Story 5.1) → Essential for idle game
- Offline Progression (Story 5.2) → Core idle game mechanic
- Performance Optimization (Story 5.3) → Launch readiness

## Integration Coordination Points

### State Management Integration
**Affected Stories:** 1.1, 1.3, 2.1-2.8, 3.1-3.3, 5.1-5.2
- All game state must flow through centralized system
- Department state extends resource state architecture
- Achievement tracking integrates with all game actions
- Save system must capture complete game state

### UI Framework Integration
**Affected Stories:** 1.5, 2.1-2.8, 3.2, 4.1, 4.3
- Department interfaces extend UI foundation components
- Achievement notifications use common UI patterns
- Visual polish enhances existing UI components
- Responsive design supports all game interfaces

### Performance Integration
**Affected Stories:** 1.1, 2.8, 4.4, 5.3
- Game loop handles all department calculations
- Visual effects must maintain 60 FPS performance
- Save operations must complete efficiently
- Performance monitoring tracks all systems

## Critical Path Analysis

### Week 1: Foundation (Epic 1)
**Milestone:** Complete game loop with basic clicking and automation
**Critical:** Stories 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4 must complete before Week 2

### Week 2: Departments (Epic 2)
**Milestone:** All seven departments functional with synergies
**Critical:** Story 2.1 must complete early to enable parallel development of other departments

### Week 3: Polish and Progression (Epic 3 + 4)
**Milestone:** Complete progression systems and premium visual experience
**Critical:** Epic 3 completion enables Epic 4 polish work

### Week 4: Launch Readiness (Epic 5)
**Milestone:** MVP ready for launch with persistence and optimization
**Critical:** All previous epics must be complete for proper save system integration

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High Risk: Department Balance Complexity
**Mitigation:** 
- Implement configurable balance constants
- Create balance testing framework in Story 2.1
- Plan iterative balance tuning throughout Week 2

### High Risk: Performance with Seven Departments
**Mitigation:**
- Performance monitoring from Story 1.1
- Efficient calculation patterns in Story 2.1
- Performance validation at each department addition

### Medium Risk: Save System Complexity
**Mitigation:**
- State architecture planning in Story 1.1
- Incremental save system development
- Migration system for state changes

### Medium Risk: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Mitigation:**
- Browser testing from Story 1.1
- Progressive enhancement approach
- Fallback systems for missing features
