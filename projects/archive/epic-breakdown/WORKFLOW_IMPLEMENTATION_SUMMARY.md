# Workflow Implementation Summary

## What Was Created

### 1. Kanban Folder Structure
```
kanban/
├── backlog/      # Stories waiting to start
├── in-progress/  # Active development
├── review/       # Awaiting review
├── blocked/      # Blocked by dependencies
└── done/         # Completed stories
```

### 2. Single-File Story Format
Instead of 3 files per story, each story is now one comprehensive markdown file with:
- **YAML Frontmatter**: Metadata including status, assignments, dependencies, time tracking
- **User Story**: Clear goal and benefit statement
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Checklist of requirements
- **Technical Design**: Architecture and implementation details
- **Implementation Plan**: Step-by-step development guide
- **Tasks**: Granular work items with time estimates
- **Dependencies**: What blocks this and what this blocks
- **Definition of Done**: Clear completion criteria
- **Notes**: Ongoing decisions and considerations

### 3. Automation Scripts

#### move-story.sh
- Moves stories between kanban states
- Updates status in file metadata
- Maintains timestamp for tracking

#### generate-dashboard.sh
- Creates visual progress dashboard
- Shows overall progress with progress bars
- Breaks down progress by epic
- Lists stories by current state
- Tracks blocked dependencies

#### create-story.sh
- Creates new stories with proper template
- Ensures consistent format
- Places in backlog by default

#### migrate-to-kanban.sh
- One-time migration from 3-file format
- Preserves all content in new structure

### 4. Progress Tracking

The dashboard provides:
- **Overall Progress**: 4% complete (1/23 stories)
- **State Distribution**: Visual breakdown of where stories are
- **Epic Progress**: Individual progress bars for each epic
- **Story Details**: Listed by current state with metadata

## Key Benefits Achieved

### 1. **Simplified File Management**
- From 69 files (3×23) down to 23 files
- Easier to navigate and find stories
- Single source of truth per story

### 2. **Visual State Management**
- Folder structure = kanban board
- See progress at a glance
- Natural workflow progression

### 3. **Automation Support**
- Scripts handle repetitive tasks
- Consistent state transitions
- Automatic dashboard generation

### 4. **Git-Friendly Workflow**
- File moves tracked in version control
- Clear history of state changes
- Collaborative development support

### 5. **Flexibility**
- Easy to add new states if needed
- Scripts can be extended
- Works offline without external tools

## Usage Example

```bash
# Start work on a story
./move-story.sh epic-2-story-2-3-customer-experience.md in-progress

# Complete and move to review
./move-story.sh epic-2-story-2-3-customer-experience.md review

# After review, mark as done
./move-story.sh epic-2-story-2-3-customer-experience.md done

# Check progress
./generate-dashboard.sh
cat reports/progress-dashboard.md
```

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Migrate Remaining Epic 1 Stories**: Run migration script for stories 1.2-1.5
2. **Create Remaining Stories**: Use create-story.sh for Epic 2-5 stories
3. **Establish Workflow**: Team adopts the kanban process
4. **Regular Updates**: Generate dashboard daily/weekly
5. **Iterate on Process**: Adjust scripts and workflow as needed

## Comparison to Original Request

### Original Approach Issues:
- 69 files for 23 stories (overwhelming)
- No state visibility
- Difficult to track progress
- Hard to see dependencies

### New Approach Solutions:
- 23 files total (one per story)
- Visual kanban states via folders
- Automated progress tracking
- Clear dependency management
- Scriptable workflow automation

This implementation provides a lightweight, file-based project management system that mimics kanban boards while maintaining the benefits of markdown documentation and git version control.
