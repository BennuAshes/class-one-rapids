## Executive Overview

PetSoft Tycoon is a web-based idle clicker game that transforms the traditional business simulation genre by focusing on building a pet software company. Players progress from a garage startup to a billion-dollar tech empire, developing software solutions for pet businesses while managing seven interconnected departments (Development, Sales, Customer Experience, Product, Design, QA, and Marketing).

The game combines proven idle game mechanics with compelling narrative progression, offering immediate satisfaction through rapid early progression while maintaining long-term engagement through strategic depth and prestige systems. Built with performance-first architecture targeting 60 FPS on 5-year-old devices, PetSoft Tycoon delivers premium game feel through exceptional polish and attention to detail.

**Target Audience:** Casual and hardcore idle game players, entrepreneurs, and software professionals  
**Platform:** Web (HTML5/JavaScript) with mobile-responsive design  
**Development Timeline:** 4 weeks (3 weeks development + 1 week polish)

## User Stories

### Epic 1: Core Game Loop (MVP Critical)

**US-001: Basic Code Production**  
As a player starting the game, I want to click a button to write code so that I can immediately begin producing resources and understand the core mechanic.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I am on the game screen, when I click the "WRITE CODE" button, then I gain +1 Line of Code with visual and audio feedback
- Given I have clicked 5 times, when the counter updates, then a "Hire Junior Dev $10" button appears
- Given I have sufficient money, when I purchase a Junior Dev, then automatic code production begins at 0.1 lines/second

**US-002: Feature Conversion System**  
As a player with code, I want to convert lines of code into features so that I can generate revenue and progress toward business growth.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have 10+ lines of code, when I click "Ship Feature", then 10 lines convert to 1 Basic Feature and I earn $15
- Given I complete a feature conversion, when the transaction processes, then money counter appears with cash register sound
- Given I have money, when feature conversion completes, then upgrade options become available

**US-003: Department Automation**  
As a player managing multiple resources, I want to hire managers to automate departments so that I can focus on strategic decisions rather than repetitive clicking.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I reach $50,000 total earnings, when the milestone triggers, then manager automation unlocks for all departments
- Given I purchase a department manager, when automation activates, then that department continues producing while I'm away from the screen
- Given a department has a manager, when I return to the game, then offline progression is calculated and applied

### Epic 2: Multi-Department Strategy (MVP Core)

**US-004: Sales Department Operations**  
As a player expanding beyond development, I want to hire sales staff to generate customer leads so that I can multiply the value of my features through customer relationships.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I reach $500 total earned, when the threshold triggers, then Sales department unlocks with visible office expansion
- Given I hire a Sales Rep, when they begin working, then they generate 0.2 Customer Leads per second
- Given I have both Leads and Features, when I combine them, then I receive higher revenue than selling features alone

**US-005: Customer Experience Impact**  
As a player building a sustainable business, I want to invest in customer support so that I can increase customer retention and multiply long-term revenue.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have active customers, when I hire Support Agents, then they resolve tickets and increase retention multiplier
- Given improved retention, when customers make repeat purchases, then I receive increased revenue per transaction
- Given high customer satisfaction, when retention bonuses apply, then revenue multiplier increases from 1.1x up to 3x

**US-006: Department Synergies**  
As a strategic player, I want departments to work together and create multiplier effects so that optimal resource allocation becomes a meaningful strategic decision.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I have multiple departments active, when certain thresholds are reached, then cross-department bonuses activate
- Given I reach 25 units in a department, when the milestone triggers, then a 2x efficiency multiplier applies
- Given I reach 50 units in a department, when the second milestone triggers, then additional specialized bonuses unlock

### Epic 3: Progression and Prestige (MVP Extended)

**US-007: Prestige System Implementation**  
As a player reaching mid-game limits, I want to reset my progress for permanent bonuses so that I can break through progression barriers and achieve exponentially higher goals.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I reach $10 million valuation, when prestige becomes available, then "Investor Round" option appears with clear benefit explanation
- Given I choose to prestige, when the reset processes, then I receive Investor Points based on my valuation (1 IP per $1M)
- Given I have Investor Points, when I start a new run, then permanent bonuses apply: +10% starting capital per IP, +1% global speed per IP

**US-008: Achievement System**  
As a player seeking goals and recognition, I want to unlock achievements for significant milestones so that I have clear progression targets and feel rewarded for exploration.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I complete notable actions, when achievement conditions are met, then achievement notifications appear with celebration effects
- Given I unlock achievements, when I view my progress, then I can see both completed and upcoming achievement targets
- Given achievements provide bonuses, when they unlock, then gameplay benefits apply immediately and visibly

### Epic 4: Polish and User Experience (MVP Quality)

**US-009: Visual and Audio Feedback**  
As a player taking actions in the game, I want immediate and satisfying feedback so that every interaction feels responsive and rewarding.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I perform any game action, when the action processes, then visual feedback appears within 50ms
- Given I reach significant milestones, when they trigger, then appropriate particle effects and screen animations play
- Given audio is enabled, when actions occur, then contextual sounds play with appropriate volume balancing

**US-010: Save System and Offline Progression**  
As a player with limited continuous play time, I want my progress to save automatically and continue while offline so that I can make meaningful progress even with irregular play sessions.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Given I'm playing the game, when 30 seconds pass, then progress automatically saves to local storage
- Given I close the game and return, when the game loads, then offline progression is calculated for up to 12 hours
- Given offline time exceeds 12 hours, when I return, then I receive the maximum 12-hour benefit with notification of the time cap
