## üé∞ New Dopamine Mechanics

### 1. COMBO CLICKS
```
Rapid clicking builds combo:
- 5 clicks in 2 sec: 2x multiplier
- 10 clicks in 3 sec: 5x multiplier
- 20 clicks in 5 sec: 10x multiplier + FEVER MODE
- Fever Mode: All production 100x for 10 seconds!
```

### 2. GOLDEN BUGS
```
Every 30-60 seconds, a golden bug appears:
- Click it for instant rewards:
  - 7x current Code/sec production (77% chance)
  - 10 seconds of 10x production (20% chance)
  - JACKPOT: 100x money (3% chance)
- Creates "hunt" behavior between idle moments
```

### 3. CASCADE PURCHASES
```
Buying 10/25/50/100 of any unit triggers CASCADE:
- Screen fills with particles
- All numbers grow 50% faster for 30 seconds
- Bonus stacks with other cascades
- Visual: Matrix-style number rain
```

### 4. MILESTONE EXPLOSIONS
```
Hit round numbers ‚Üí EXPLOSION:
- 1,000 Code: Screen flash + 2x permanent click
- 10,000 Code: Fireworks + unlock new tier
- 100K Code: MEGA BLAST + free upgrade
- 1M Code: UNIVERSE SHAKES + prestige option
```

### 5. THE OVERFLOW SYSTEM
```
When any number gets "too big":
- Number literally breaks out of container
- Shatters into smaller numbers
- Each fragment collectible for bonus
- Creates active "cleanup" gameplay
```

## üè¢ Simplified Department System

### Phase 1: Just Two Departments (0-10 min)
```
DEVELOPMENT:
- Intern: 1 Code/sec ($10)
- Coder: 10 Code/sec ($100)
- Hacker: 100 Code/sec ($10K)

SALES:
- Converts Code ‚Üí Money (10x multiplier)
- Each sale has chance for "BIG DEAL" (100x)
```

### Phase 2: The Third Wheel (10-30 min)
```
MARKETING:
- Multiplies both Code AND Money
- Creates "Viral Moments" (everything 10x for 30 sec)
```

### Phase 3: The Rest Unlock Naturally (30+ min)
```
One department per prestige level:
- Prestige 1: QA (reduces "bug tax")
- Prestige 2: Design (pretty numbers = bigger numbers)
- Prestige 3: Customer Success (passive income)
- Prestige 4: Product (unlock "Super Features")
```

First purchase: 3 seconds (was 30)
First automation: 5 seconds (was 30)
First department: 30 seconds (was 3 minutes)
First "WOW" number (1M): 2 minutes (was never)
First prestige available: 5 minutes (was 30+)

## üé® Visual & Audio Overhaul

### Every Second Needs Feedback
```
Constant particle streams showing production
Numbers floating up from every department
Pulsing glow on anything producing
Speed lines when production accelerates
Screen shake intensity = production rate
```

### Audio Dynamics
```
- Base drum beat matches production rate
- Each purchase adds instrument layer
- Combo clicks create musical scales
- Big numbers = bass drops
- Prestige = full orchestral hit
- Background music tempo = Code/second (capped at 180 BPM)
```

### The "BRRR" Effect
```
When production hits certain thresholds:
- 100/sec: Slight screen vibration
- 1K/sec: Visible "BRRR" text appears
- 10K/sec: Money printer sound effect
- 100K/sec: Screen tears with speed lines
- 1M/sec: MAXIMUM OVERDRIVE MODE
```

## üéØ The Five Commandments

1. **Every click must feel powerful** (never just +1)
2. **Something must happen every 3 seconds** (purchase, unlock, achievement)
3. **Numbers must explode, not crawl** (exponential from second 1)
4. **More is always better** (particles, sounds, numbers, unlocks)
5. **When in doubt, make it faster** (halve all wait times)

---

## Summary

This redesign transforms PetSoft Tycoon from a slow strategic simulation into a dopamine-delivery machine wearing a tech theme costume. Every system has been accelerated 5-10x, every number multiplied by 100x, and every wait removed.

The game now delivers what idle players crave: instant gratification, exponential growth, and the beautiful chaos of numbers exploding beyond comprehension. It's less "Software Development Tycoon" and more "Watch Numbers Go BRRR: Tech Edition."

**Expected Result:** Players won't be able to stop clicking, watching, and optimizing. The question changes from "Is this fun?" to "How do I stop playing?"
