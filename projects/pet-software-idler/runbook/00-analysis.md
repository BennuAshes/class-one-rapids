- ✅ Risk mitigation strategies documented
- ✅ Team has clear understanding of implementation approach

## Technical Analysis

### Architecture Pattern Validation

#### Vertical Slicing Mapping
Based on PRD analysis, features map to vertical slices as follows:

```
Core Features:
├── core/           # Player resources, clicking, prestige
├── development/    # Code generation (primary production)
├── sales/          # Revenue conversion (primary monetization)
└── customer-exp/   # Customer satisfaction (revenue multiplier)

Advanced Features:
├── product/        # Feature enhancement (2x value creation)
├── design/         # User experience (polish multipliers)
├── qa/            # Bug prevention (quality bonuses)
└── marketing/     # Brand building (viral multipliers)
```

**Validation Result**: ✅ Each feature represents a complete value slice from UI to business logic.

#### Feature Independence Analysis
- **Development**: Generates lines of code → No dependencies
- **Sales**: Consumes features + leads → Depends on development output
- **Customer-Exp**: Processes revenue → Depends on sales activity
- **Product**: Enhances existing features → Depends on development baseline
- **Design**: Applies experience multipliers → Cross-department bonuses
- **QA**: Reduces bugs globally → Affects all departments
- **Marketing**: Multiplies lead generation → Enhances sales input

**Validation Result**: ✅ Dependencies follow logical game progression without tight coupling.

- Limited OTA updates

Game Requirements:
- Standard React Native APIs sufficient
- No complex native integrations required
- OTA updates valuable for game balancing
```

**Validation Result**: ✅ Managed workflow meets all requirements with operational benefits.

### Performance Requirements Analysis

#### Target Specifications
```
Minimum Device Specs:
- Android 5.0+ (API 21+)
- 2GB RAM
- Single-core 1.5GHz processor
- OpenGL ES 2.0

Performance Targets:
- 30+ FPS sustained gameplay
- <200MB memory usage
- <3s app launch time

```

#### Critical Performance Points
1. **Production Loop Updates**: Multiple departments calculating per second
2. **Large Number Animations**: Money counters, resource displays
3. **Save/Load Operations**: Complex game state serialization
4. **Offline Progression**: Retroactive calculation on app resume

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Use FlatList for department lists
- Implement AnimatedNumber component with native driver
- Optimize save format with incremental updates
- Limit offline progression to 24 hours max
