## ‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Requiring Attention

### 1. FlashList Integration Missing
**Impact**: Suboptimal list performance
**Fix**: Add `@shopify/flash-list` to dependencies and replace FlatList usage

### 2. Image Optimization Strategy
**Impact**: Larger bundle size
**Fix**: Implement expo-image with webp format

### 3. Error Boundaries Not Implemented
**Impact**: Poor error recovery UX
**Fix**: Add React Error Boundaries in Phase 2

### 4. Accessibility Gaps
**Impact**: May fail app store requirements
**Fix**: Add accessibility props to all interactive elements

### 5. Bundle Analysis Tools Missing
**Impact**: No visibility into bundle size
**Fix**: Add webpack-config analyzer in Phase 5

## üö® Critical Action Items

### Must Fix Before Production
1. **Add FlashList dependency**
   ```bash
   npm install @shopify/flash-list
   ```

2. **Implement Error Boundaries**
   - Add to core game component wrapper
   - Include crash reporting integration

3. **Bundle Size Monitoring**
   ```bash
   npx expo export --analyze
   ```

## üí° Optimization Recommendations

### Performance Enhancements
- Replace FlatList with FlashList (90% memory improvement)
- Implement expo-image for 60% smaller images
- Add platform-specific optimizations

### Testing Framework
- Consider Vitest migration for better performance
- Add performance regression tests
- Implement automated accessibility testing

### Monitoring & Analytics
- Enhanced crash reporting with context
- Performance metrics dashboard
- User engagement tracking
